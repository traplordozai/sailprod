Nevertheless, I grew up with opportunities many young women in my culture could not access. For example, as a first-generation university student, I was ecstatic about all the doors opening for me. Unfortunately, my excitement ended quickly when a group of young men assaulted me. For years, I carried the weight of the assault alone. I often wondered if I brought the assault upon myself. This experience highlighted the systemic barriers many young women face and inspired my journey into advocacy.

I began my career working for the Centre for Social Innovation, managing the multi-million dollar renovation of a heritage building aimed at becoming a hub for community organizations. Collaborating with a team of strong, driven women helped me to heal. Over 12 years, I dedicated myself to corporate social responsibility, raising significant funds to support young people facing adversity. However, I grew frustrated by the persistent inequities in society, particularly in addressing gender-based violence and supporting survivors. While advocacy and community-building were impactful, I realized that my efforts could only do so much without legal tools. 

In 2024, I am taking the next step in my career by studying law. I hope to address the equity gaps in our society and ensure that the legal profession further attends to the lived experiences of marginalized groups. 

Throughout my journey, mentors and community networks have lifted me up, showing me the power of collective action. Not everyone will have access to the support I had, and I am committed to using my education to help other young women who survived sexual violence.",,"Later in my career, I worked at the International Zeolite Corporation, which operates in Ontario and British Columbia. My work focused primarily on writing significant government proposals. I gained $144,000 for the mining company's production facility and marketing initiatives. Additionally, my team focused heavily on maintaining positive relationships and thorough land investigation to ensure we respected the Tsilhqot'in land claim (established in TsilhqotÊ¼in Nation v British Columbia). The claim states that Aboriginal title exists on the land and that there must be adequate consultation and accommodation of Aboriginal title and rights to the land. My team and I took this responsibility extremely seriously. For each significant grant proposal to Agriculture Canada and the Ontario government, I compiled letters from regional farmers and the Upper Similkameen Indian Band. I also reviewed documentation of archaeological materials outlining how to identify buried hearths and Indigenous artifacts. While no archaeological sites were within the area, sites were identified nearby, and any development on the project could not be prioritized over preservation and respectful management of archaeological material. Thus, I prepared documentation demonstrating our commitment to sustainable development and respectful engagement with Indigenous communities during the mining project. I collaborated with corporate stakeholders and community leaders to balance operational needs with ongoing cultural preservation.

As highlighted in my resumÃ©, my research qualifications in mining are well-established. Securing funding from provincial and federal governments is highly competitive and requires precise teamwork. Collaboration between the technical department, communications lead, and budget development executive was essential. Our team successfully demonstrated how an innovative mineral product and a Canadian mining location could meet the fertilizer market's needs during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. I have never been prouder of anything. With my background in local and international research and my determination to contribute to social progress, I am confident that my skills will enable me to contribute to international law.","Later in my career, I worked at the International Zeolite Corporation, which operates in Ontario and British Columbia.

My twelve years of professional work experience in large-scale capital project management, not-for-profit community development, and government fundraising for at-risk youth uniquely position me to excel in the role.

I have worked on multiple multi-million-dollar capital projects in the non-profit sector. Often, these projects come at a critical point in organizational growth and are designed to protect the companyâs long-term financial security. This real-estate investment strategy works until such challenges emerge, like a global pandemic or massive mortgage interest rate increase. I have seen firsthand how challenging it is for communities of people to cope without proper financial planning and knowledge. The business sector is well-positioned to address social inequity in our communities using advanced financial tools and sharing financial knowledge. I want to support this mission using my legal education.

While serving as the President of Social Enterprise Consulting and Director of the Toronto Outdoor Art Fair, I gained foundational skills in leadership, client advocacy, and learning the importance of time management. Earlier in my career, I honed my project management skills at the Centre for Social Innovation while balancing the needs of community members and stakeholders. There are often hundreds of competing tasks, and knowing which one takes priority while maintaining professional behaviour is essential. These experiences have prepared me to transition seamlessly onto a team in the business law sector.
  
Some additional highlights of the experience I bring to the field include:
I used my advanced writing skills to advocate for young women, female-led organizations, and charities geared toward helping marginalized groups by spearheading government fundraising projects. 
I improved company operational efficiency by strategically planning and prioritizing tasks and ensuring my team and I met deadlines.
Finally, I enhanced workplace relationships by establishing positive, respectful connections, maintaining a comfortable/safe environment, and tailoring services to meet clientsâ needs while exceeding company goals.

Through my professional experiences, I have developed a passion for helping others grow and succeed professionally. I am excited to see where I can fit in the field of business law.","Later in my career, I worked at the International Zeolite Corporation, a mining company in Ontario and British Columbia. My work focused on writing and securing government proposals, and I successfully obtained $144,000 in funding for production facilities and marketing initiatives. My team also prioritized respectful engagement with Indigenous communities, particularly in light of the Tsilhqotâin land claim (established inÂ Tsilhqotâin Nation v. British Columbia), which affirmed Aboriginal title and emphasized the need for consultation and accommodation.

I led efforts to compile letters of support from regional farmers and the Upper Similkameen Indian Band for grant proposals to Agriculture Canada and the Ontario government. I also reviewed archaeological documentation to protect Indigenous artifacts and historical sites, preparing thorough documentation to demonstrate our commitment to sustainable development. This experience taught me the importance of balancing operational goals with cultural preservation, an approach rooted in collaboration between corporate stakeholders and community leaders.
My success in securing competitive funding required precise teamwork, particularly during the commercialization of innovative mineral products to meet market demands during the fertilizer supply crisis triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. These experiences honed my ability to navigate complex challenges and demonstrated my ability to align innovation with legal and ethical compliance.
Through these experiences, I developed a strong foundation in intellectual property (IP) and its intersection with sustainable development. Protecting innovation while respecting cultural and community rights is at the core of my professional ethos. I am excited to bring this commitment to intellectual property law, where I can help clients safeguard their innovations and navigate the complexities of IP rights in a globalized economy.

As a mature student and aspiring lawyer, I bring twelve years of professional experience in capital project management, not-for-profit development, and government fundraising. My ability to advocate for marginalized communities, improve operational efficiency, and foster positive relationships positions me to excel in IP law.
I am drawn to IP law because it protects creativity and innovation while advancing equitable access to knowledge and resources. With my professional background and legal education, I aim to help innovators and organizations thrive while contributing to sustainable, ethical progress.",315274.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2zeZAfpbmyzr5N8,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_27PAQahDx0IDfb5,Toronto,"In-Person,Remote,Hybrid",,,,,,,,,

From a young age, I became acutely aware of the systemic inequities impacting different groups, igniting my passion for addressing inequalities and human rights.

This background drives my desire to explore innovative approaches to human rights law within the framework of international law. I am particularly curious about questions such as: How can international law more effectively protect the rights of Indigenous communities? What mechanisms ensure the consistent enforcement of human rights across borders? And how do cultural perspectives influence the interpretation and application of international human rights law? I would love the opportunity to be in a workplace where questions like these are quarrelled with every day.

I am also eager to learn more about where the future of international law is heading. As our world becomes more interconnected, international law faces the challenge of adapting to a time of intense integration. Alongside the current political climate, the relevance of international law in relation to human rights is extremely pertinent. 

Through various employment opportunities, including managerial roles and tutoring English, I have developed strong communication skills that I believe are essential for success in international law. Particularly valuable to me was my time spent tutoring English, which gave me the opportunity to interact with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. I was able to build on my skills, learning how to effectively share ideas and adapt to different perspectives. Combined with my capacity to navigate cross-cultural settings and advocate effectively, I am confident in my ability to make a meaningful contribution to the field.","I am eager to pursue an externship in environmental law because it offers the opportunity to address some of the most pressing challenges facing our planet today. Issues such as climate change, pollution, and the depletion of natural resources are having profound effects on ecosystems, economies, and communities. Environmental law provides the tools to develop solutions that protect the environment for future generations, and I am excited to learn more about how these tools are applied.

For me, environmental law is a way to combine my passion for sustainability with my legal education to advocate for meaningful change. It provides the chance to contribute to shaping policies, enforcing regulations, and participating in international negotiations to ensure both environmental protection and social justice.

As the world becomes more interconnected and environmental concerns increasingly shape global politics, I view environmental law as a dynamic and impactful field. It offers me the opportunity to make a lasting contribution toward a more sustainable and equitable future for all.

I am particularly interested in exploring how Indigenous communities influence or challenge environmental laws that may conflict with their cultural practices or land rights. Additionally, I am curious about how environmental law can strike a balance between economic development and environmental sustainability, as well as how emerging technologies are impacting the legal landscape of environmental protection. This field resonates deeply with me, as I am personally invested in addressing environmental issues and working toward a more sustainable future.","As someone with previous experience managing a health clinic, I have seen firsthand the necessity of labor and employment law in ensuring that employees are treated equitably, regardless of their background or identity. This is essential for a just and fair society. I am passionate about exploring the nuances of collective bargaining, employee benefits, and workplace regulations, to better understand how legal frameworks can evolve to meet the needs of both employers and employees in an ever-changing economy.

I am eager to learn more about the intersection between international law and labor and employment law. As workforces become increasingly diverse and global, with more work being offshored, it is crucial to understand how labor laws will adapt to these shifts. I am particularly interested in exploring how labor rights are established, enforced, and sustained across different jurisdictions and economic landscapes.

In addition to my professional experiences, I studied the Industrial Revolution from a literary perspective during my undergraduate years, which deepened my interest in the historical and ongoing development of labor law. This academic foundation, combined with my extensive employment experience across various roles, positions me to contribute meaningfully to this field. I am excited about the opportunity to deepen my understanding of this field and contribute to shaping fair and equitable work environments for all.
","My passion for family law is driven by my deep commitment to ensuring that children's rights and needs are prioritized in legal decisions. Growing up in a blended family has provided me with a nuanced and honest perspective on family law. This experience has helped me develop an empathetic communication style, which I believe will enable me to connect with individuals navigating difficult family situations. My particular focus is on custody law and how the legal system addresses a childâs needs, especially in complex family dynamics.

Having personally experienced the custody process, I am driven to advocate for children, ensuring their voices are heard and their well-being is at the heart of family law decisions. I aspire to contribute to a legal framework that prioritizes the needs of children and supports families through these difficult processes in a fair and compassionate way.

I am confident that I would thrive in an externship that allows me to further explore and deepen my understanding of family law, as it aligns with both my passion and my career aspirations.","My interest in business law stems from my hands-on experience running my own tutoring business and managing office responsibilities. These experiences gave me insight into the critical legal and organizational aspects that drive a successful business. As a business owner, I navigated the complexities of contracts, client relations, and financial management. Additionally, my time as an office manager allowed me to further develop my understanding of corporate responsibilities, employee relations, and the importance of compliance with regulatory frameworks.

I am particularly interested in how business law facilitates growth and ensures fairness, both for companies and consumers. I am eager to explore topics such as corporate governance, intellectual property rights, and dispute resolution, as I believe they are integral to maintaining ethical business practices. By combining my practical experience with legal knowledge, I aim to contribute to businesses that operate with integrity and in alignment with the law.

With my background in entrepreneurship and office management, I am excited about the possibility of gaining a deeper understanding of the legal complexities that shape the business world, and how I can contribute to the development of fair and innovative business solutions.

After my first term of 1L though, exposure to the core courses helped me in broadening my interests and bringing back my aspiration to implement change as a lawyer and âmake things right.â When I first started working full time at Canadian RiteRate Energy Corporation, I enjoyed doing analytics and applying my academic theory and knowledge in real life. However, an equal, if not larger part of me also really enjoyed the interactions I had with clients. At the time, the company was a natural gas supplier serving residential, commercial, and industrial clients. Whether it was taking calls from households asking about their monthly rate, presenting slide decks to condominium shareholder boards, or generating monthly market fundamental reports and visiting our factory clients, the person aspect of the role brought me excitement. With this in mind, I strive to seek a connection with others where I am able to use my expertise to educate and help them otherwise with the issues they face. I personally believe the social justice and human rights law practice area to be the most impactful in helping me achieve these goals. In return, I am a highly passionate individual with well-developed creativity and autonomy. I am able to work independently, but also collaboratively where required. I have trained myself to ask directed questions when starting new projects and I am good at studying existing procedures and guidelines to create deliverables.

I am good at managing my time and can quickly adapt to timelines, switching between tasks to ensure the best output is yielded.",,"As the child of two Chinese immigrants, and as a second generation Canadian, I have always been curious about the international landscape and drawing connections and parallels between countries on a number of different areas. This interest was established earlier on in my life, and expanded during my undergraduate degree as an HBA student at the Ivey Business School. As business principles and practices are more highly transferrable, I have developed a keen interest in exploring international matters through a law lens (from the perspective that legal aspects vary more greatly between countries). In particular, I am most interested in going to a micro level in exploring the types and causes of differences. For example, would it be that statutes are different, their interpretation, or more so due to larger overarching concepts like different government structures? I am fascinated by the links that can be drawn to reconcile these discrepancies in legal systems amongst countries. I also hold longer term goals to either practice in the U.S. or pursue higher education there. I personally find that learning on the job is a great way to absorb knowledge and establish expectations, and I believe an externship in international law will greatly shape my outlook.

At Canadian RiteRate Energy Corporation (Canadian RiteRate), a natural gas marketer, I worked with clients on managing their supply and pricing strategies to meet their needs. My transition to the Ontario Energy Board in December 2023 led to my exposure to electricity distribution rates and managing utility applications. While the topics of energy and environmental are not synonymous, I believe that they are tied together. For instance, as the demand for energy continues to grow in the upcoming years, changes around environmental policies and practice will continue to evolve. While most of my personal exposure to environmental law has been around corporate responsibility and ESG, I am interested in exploring the other practice areas often covered, such as the protection of threatened and endangered species, air and water quality, renewable energy, and working with Indigenous communities among others. I am excited at opportunities where I may be able to carry on my previously developed expertise. I am a highly passionate individual with well-developed creativity and autonomy.

Over the majority of the past four years, I have worked at Canadian RiteRate Energy Corporation (Canadian RiteRate), a natural gas marketer. As a small business, I received highly hands-on training and experiences in which I worked on a daily basis from accounting and analytics to transactions and operations. Canadian RiteRate traded over-the-counter forward contract derivative products with counterparties in managing natural gas supply. I am familiar with researching market fundamentals as well as concepts such as basis, locational swaps, and tracking pricing from the NYMEX futures contracts. Lastly, I also have experience with industry contracts like the natural gas electronic data interchange (EDI), NDAs, and residential conditions and terms.

At the time, an upper year Western Law student taking the intellectual property course helped us in completing research to ensure that we were not infringing on any existing trademarks. Since then, I have personally been able to learn more about intellectual property in the 1L fall term in Property Law, where we covered the basics of copyrights, trademarks, and patents. I also have a very brief experience to trademarking as an employee at Canadian RiteRate Energy Corporation. At the time, the company was looking at a rebranding following a customer base change. Research was done by a third party around existing companies and the process to trademark that I was able to review and learn from. While I personally do not come from a scientific background, I am interested in intellectual property because it applies to a lot of content I would not have originally associated with, such as art displays. The concept of unregistered intellectual property also brings a level of complexity and uncertainty that I find interesting.

Feminism, Indigenous ways of knowing, colonialism, and accessibility never truly left the classroom, and I leaned into that throughout my studies. 
Our faculty, like every other music faculty in the country, had recently been shaken into action by âHungry Listeningâ, a book published by Dylan Robinson which critiqued how universities insulated music education within colonialism and hindered reconciliation. One of the many issues discussed in the book is the role that music plays in Indigenous histories, and how it has historically been inadmissible in courts. A poignant example of the failure of the Canadian Legal System to consider Indigenous ways of knowing and, more specifically, their musical record of law comes from 1985. In Delgamuukw v. the Queen (1985), Justice Walt Taylor in British Columbia objected to the use of a Gitksan song as evidence for the still effective Gitskan law due to his âtin earâ. Our understanding of law as it relates to Indigenous communities has evolved since then, but we are still far from reconciliation.
My time studying and writing about these issues was impactful, but it was extremely frustrating not having the tools to do anything about these issues. I hope to harness the knowledge I have gained throughout my education to expand access to justice to marginalised groups. I am particularly passionate about ensuring women and Indigenous communities have access to legal services, and hope to learn more about advocating for restorative justice. 
My artistic background and experience exploring ways to not just include but adapt Western music traditions to welcome marginalised groups will bring a unique perspective to a legal team. I hope to leverage this knowledge as I work towards a career underpinned by restorative justice, but this time with more tools to enact change. I know that the research, writing, and oral communication skills that I developed throughout my education will be an asset and I look forward to directing these skills towards expanding access to justice.","A few years before coming to law school, I was starting my adult life at my first full time job and was excited to buy my first car. It took a while, but finally, I found the perfect car. I was ecstatic. I immediately signed the contract, put down the deposit and was on my merry way to celebrate when I the dealer called and told me they intended to break the contract because they had intended to sell the car at a higher price. I struggled to advocate for myself, reminding him that I we had already signed a contract, and I had given him a deposit, but there was no reasoning with him. There have been few moments where I have felt more frustrated and more helpless. This dispute only lasted a few weeks, but I have never been more grateful have known a lawyer. I never ended up getting that car, but it did spark my interest in the law.
At that first full-time job, I worked as a proposal writer in the engineering industry where I honed skills that will be invaluable in law including persuasive writing and collaboration skills. As the leader of the proposal team, I managed a multidisciplinary team and crafted hundreds of winning proposals. On one occasion, I worked with the executive and engineering teams negotiate a 150% fee increase for a project that had ballooned in scope. This proposal required I work quickly and closely with both teams to synthesis the business goals with the technical input to present a persuasive proposal. My role often demanded that I manage a heavy workload on tight deadlines, and this was especially difficult, but we successfully negotiated the fee increase.
I am excited for the opportunity to use the skills I developed in the engineering to help people navigate private law disputes. Like many people, my experience with legal disputes has been limited, but they have been influential. I am interested in private law because I hope to be the lawyer that helps someone navigate their legal dispute and advocate on their behalf.","Prior to law school, I was a classical violinist which taught me to collaborate efficiently, and problem solve in high pressure situations. Often as a performer I had limited opportunities to rehearse with my colleagues before a performance where the standard was perfection. I worked with anywhere from one to 50 colleagues to ensure every aspect of the performance was coordinated right down to our breathing. If something went awry on stage, I had to act quickly and find creative ways to correct our course. These corrections could be as small as subtly cuing my partner or could require that I improvise on stage to realign the group. My ability to maintain my composure, communicate, and adapt to the needs of a group will enable me to efficiently collaborate with a legal team to address complex challenges with precision and creativity. 
As a result of my background, my interest in international law began with copyright. As a musician I interacted with copyright on a daily basis and became interested in how it functioned throughout my studies. However, my exposure to international law outside of this has been limited and I am eager to learn. I am curious what legal issues international lawyers in Canada encounter in their day-to-day practice rather than the sensationalised issues I am normally exposed to. I am also eager to learn how Canadian law fits within the international legal system. 
I hope to one day work with artists whose disputes are not always contained within our boarders. My hope is that by working in an international law setting, I will learn how to effectively address the challenges that accompany transnational disputes. I am confident that my ability to adapt, communicate, and creatively problem solve will make me an asset in international law and I look forward to growing my skills in such a dynamic practice area.",,,,"Prior to law school, I was a classical violinist which taught me to collaborate efficiently, and problem solve in high pressure situations.

On one occasion, I worked with c-suite executives and the engineering team to negotiate a 150% fee increase for the design of the new London Childrenâs Museum which had ballooned in scope. This proposal required I work quickly and closely with both teams to synthesize the business goals with the technical input to present a persuasive proposal. This was one of many projects that tested the nerves of steel I developed as a performer due to the heavy workload and tight deadlines. In this role, I learned to work effectively and efficiently with experts to craft precise and persuasive technical documents in an industry outside my expertise. 

	I am excited to leverage my skill and diverse work history in another fast-paced environment. I am eager to learn more about business law and I know that my collaboration, communication, and problem-solving skills will make me an asset to a legal team.","Over my 8-year career as a musician I have watched intellectual property become inseparable from technological advances. For better or worse, the advent of websites like Napster, Archive of Our Own (AO3), streaming services like Spotify, and now AI have fundamentally changed the way our culture views intellectual property and ownership. As we grapple with the effects of the digital age, artists and lawyers are in the process of negotiating how we will create and monetize art going forward. The truth is, I chose to study law because I want a seat at the table when those decisions are being made. I am passionate about advocating for the rights of creators and I hope to build a career defending copyright and trademarks. 

My diverse work experiences spans music, engineering, and business which gives me a unique perspective with which to approach intellectual property issues. I have proven throughout my arts education that I am able to effectively interpret subtle distinctions in art and defend my analyse among experts. My research experience includes the publication of my analyses of feminist literature in Mouvances Francophones and a large-scale, original research project analysing 20th century works. Following graduation, I successfully transferred my research and writing skills to the engineering industry as a proposal writer. In my new role, I led a multidisciplinary team and crafted proposals that won projects at hospitals, post-secondary institutions, and net-zero facilities across Ontario. I worked closely with both the engineering and executive teams to manage workloads, review mechanical and electrical drawings, assess the scope of work, calculate construction costs and fees, estimate construction schedules, and coordinate with other disciplines as both prime and sub consultant. The project I am most proud of from my time in the engineering industry was when I helped to successfully negotiate a 150% fee increase for a project that had ballooned in scope. 

I am excited to once again adapt my research and writing skills to a dynamic industry. Combined with my unique perspective, which mirrors intellectual propertyâs intersection with creative and technical disciplines, I will be an asset to a legal team.",226817.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_12SxqMuuFWv4r6o,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3n6rRiGHDvn97K0,,,,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,,5.0,1.0

As an individual with learning disabilities and ADHD, I have benefited immensely from academic accommodations that were instrumental to my success. I have also come to recognize the inequities inherent to the public education system, including students who find themselves unable to access assessments or require an educational advocate. This realization fueled my commitment to advocating on behalf of individuals with disabilities. This year, I had the privilege of doing pro bono work through the WAGS Accessible Education Project, conducting legal research to enhance the availability of resources for individuals with disabilities on campus. This work deepened my resolve to support underrepresented communities and underscored the potential of the law as a tool for meaningful change, advancing inclusion/disability rights. My Jewish identity has also been a driving force fuelling my passion for social justice and human rights, as I have been fundamentally influenced by accounts of antisemitism, persecution, and the Holocaust. These stories, and my own experiences with being the target of antisemitism, have only reinforced my understanding of the challenges faced by marginalized groups in Canada. Although I recognize my privilege and ability to âwhite passâ my Jewish identity has instilled a profound sense of responsibility to stand against oppression and injustice, both within and beyond my community. Finally, while working as a research analyst at a non-profit organization, I was provided invaluable insights into the pervasiveness of racism and discrimination in Canada. Researching the efficacy of hate crime legislation and compiling statistics on hate crimes, I came to understand the important role the law plays protecting the rights of the marginalized. Collectively, these experiences have solidified my commitment to leveraging my career in human rights law and pursuing a career where I can create systemic change.",,"Having long been interested in geo-politics, it was a natural and deliberate choice to study political science as an undergraduate at Queenâs University. During my studies, I gravitated to courses which intersected with international law such as Global Justice, Global Political Economic Development, The Politics of War in Africa and the Ethics of War and Intervention. Through lectures, research projects, and my coursework, my interest in international law and the associated enforcing organizations, continued to grow. Outside of school, I was drawn to reading and podcasts about international law and global affairs, even delving into topics such as the enforceability of arms control, economic and climate-related treaties, and the compliance or non-compliance of various actors with the systems and structures that uphold these agreements. My fascination with international law continued to grow while completing my masterâs degree in political sciences, specializing in the concentration area of nationalism, peace, ethnicity and conflict studies. My coursework and subsequent thesis focused on the structures, systems and conditions supporting state-making, maintenance and ethno-national dynamics, themes that repeatedly intersected with international law and the enforcement of legal mechanisms. When I envisioned myself applying to law, I knew I would be exploring learning opportunities in international law. Prior to beginning law school, I gained valuable work experience employed as a research analyst, working as part of a larger team to identify areas of need and further exploration. I enjoyed working collaboratively and believe that my experience in research, background in political science, and personal interest in in geo-political affairs, will be an asset during an internship in international law. I remain particularly interested in specializing in policy law and international law, and hope that an internship in international law will deepen my understanding of the field and help me evaluate this career path as I progress in my legal education and advance toward a potential legal career in public law.","From a young age I have always been passionate about nature and the environment. Throughout my childhood and adolescence, I spent my summer vacations visiting my grandparents who lived in a home northern Ontario adjacent to a large lake. There, I was happiest exploring shorelines and forests, scavenging for wild berries, fishing or swimming in the surrounding lakes. Over the last several decades however, the natural beauty of the lake I loved began to visibly change. The lake I always enjoyed had now become unsafe for swimming, as warnings were issued about harmful blue green algae blooms, damaging local wildlife. As these warnings became more frequent, I developed an interest in understanding the underlying causes of blue green algae blooms. I subsequently learned about the importance of shoreline setbacks, and the damaging impact of nutrient pollution on Ontario lakes and broader ecosystems. My interest in environmentalism expanded during my undergraduate year as I participated in the Queenâs Project for International Development. As part of the project, I became involved in environmental advocacy, hosting and organizing student panels on environmental issues including carbon emissions, the climate crisis, and water insecurity. In the summers, I kept abreast of shoreline and development bylaws being imposed in local counties. Collectively, these personal and academic experiences have influence my interest in exploring a career in environmental law, specializing in policy and government law. I am eager to learn more about the field through a summer internship position and possess excellent research skills, having completed a graduate thesis and while working as a research analyst prior to beginning law school. I hope a summer internship opportunity in environmental law will provide me with insights and practical experiences, enabling me to evaluate a potential career path as an environmental advocate in public law.","Prior to law school, I worked as a research analyst at a non-profit organization. Although I had been employed over summers and had worked part time with entrepreneurial family members, working in the non-profit sector marked the first time that I was a full-time employee, entitled to a benefits package, a probation period, vacation pay, and severance pay. At the time, I didnât think much about these clauses in my contract and largely took them for granted. It was only when I began my course in contract law first semester as a UWO law student  that was I exposed to the complexities and intricacies of contractual agreements and employment packages. Upon learning more about core questions and themes which governed issues such as wrongful dismissal, contractual amendments and contractual clauses, I became enamoured with the dynamics of employment and labour law. With this background knowledge, I re-examined my previous employment contract, began to think critically about work contracts being signed by my peers, and came to understand the value of contractual negotiations and terms. Cognizant of the demands placed on workers such as the Canada Post, I simultaneously gained an appreciation for unions.  While I come primarily from a social sciences background, I believe that I possess  research and writing skills that will be beneficial to a position in an employment law firm. I have long been interested in working in the public sector in a policy-related field, and am eager to gain summer employment experience in labour and employment law to further explore labour law as a career pathway.",,,"Before beginning law school, I was fortunate to work for several startups, both full-time and in summer employment. As a result of these experiences, I became interested in intellectual property law as it relates to small and emerging businesses. My interest in intellectual property law started when I did competitive intelligence work for Receptiviti and began learning about their different clients; how company protections varied in terms of respective safeguards for their websites, data and ideas, and the minute deviations in how such companies presented their services. When I inquired as to why the companyâs clients presented similar services with different terminologies and variations, I was exposed to the complex world of intellectual property law. Later, when I began a position at Chasqui.ai, I learned more about intellectual property law as the companyâs founder sought to differentiate his services from larger companies such as LinkedIn. I witnessed ideas and processes that could be emulated, and became curious about how certain ideas could be protected while others were publicly available. In taking property law last semester, my interest in intellectual property grew, as I gained further insight into how intellectual property protections worked, how various forms of intellectual property could only be protected for set amounts of time, and the intriguing notion of moral damages, where an artist could defend themselves if they believed their work had been wrongfully appropriated. As a result, I seriously began to consider a career in private law, in a field connected or adjacent to intellectual property. While my graduate and undergraduate background is in the arts, I believe that I possess the requisite skills, interest and knowledge to effectively work within the intellectual property field. As I advance in my legal education and in anticipation of next yearsâ recruit, I hope that an experience working in intellectual property law this summer will help me gauge if corporate law is a viable future pathway.",388229.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2y30ExCWTQOvuR2,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_12opzOKKecE9mx8,Toronto ,"Remote,Hybrid",,,,,,,,,

This opportunity was special as our community partner identified an ethical and legal realm that, from their unique vantage point, needed to be researched. They communicated that the emergence of several grievous cases of sexual harassment by democratically elected municipal officials became an important topic of reflection for their office and many communities across Ontario. Upon hearing this, my partner and I became determined to produce a meaningful research project that addressed this topical subject, which, at the time, had not received adequate attention. In pursuit of this goal, I developed a passion for studying real-world issues where policy, public concern, and the law intersect. In addition, this experience afforded me the chance to judiciously conduct critical research and effectively communicate ideas in a sensitive climate, two skills that would aid me in an externship position in this legal area.

I conducted novel research focused on the legal framework that municipal integrity commissioners operate in to respond to sexual harassment allegations, conduct investigations, and recommend penalties for this misconduct. This involved studying cases where people had been subject to sexual harassment to elicit the ethical shortcomings of the relevant provincial laws and municipal codes of conduct in practice.  My experience sparked a policy interest in the law and its application.  Following our research, I co-authored a report and presentation for the TIC titled: ""Cases of Sexual Harassment: An Examination of the Mandate & Jurisdiction of Municipal Integrity Commissioners"". We enumerated the ethical issues with the relevant legal statutes that our case studies elicited. Additionally, we recommended amendments to improve the complaint process for subjects of harassment as well as offered different mechanisms that could better equip integrity commissioners to hold democratically elected officials accountable.  I played a small role in the advancement of justice and positive change in communities following the identification of a complex issue related to the law.  The prospect of addressing other public concerns excites me.

See my resume for other public interest initiatives.",,,,"An externship in Environmental Law would provide me with a unique and invaluable opportunity to engage directly with one of the most important areas of law.  Environmental issues, such as climate change and resource conservation, are not only critical to the well-being of ecosystems and communities but also increasingly shape global economic, political, and legal landscapes.  Hands-on work in this field would be essential to help me understand how environmental regulations are implemented, interpreted, and enforced.  

During my undergraduate degree, I took a course titled âMultidisciplinary Perspectives on the Environmentâ.  I developed a deeper understanding of the intersectionality of Environmental Law, including how it relates to other areas of law such as property, public health, and international trade.  I took another course that examined the impact of globalisation on the environment in Canada, which included case studies of the impact of industrial factories on clean air as well as toxic waste dumping.  The multidisciplinary nature of this legal practice area would help me acquire knowledge and exposure to a variety of other legal realms.                                            
    ","My interest in Employment and Labour Law stems from both personal observations and academic experiences, which have fostered my deep appreciation for the balance between employee rights and employer responsibilities. As an individual who has been employed in various capacities, I have seen firsthand the challenges that both employers and employees face when navigating the dynamics of employment contracts and employment standards. These experiences have sparked my curiosity about the legal frameworks that govern the modern workplace and how they shape labor relations, equitable outcomes, and workplace culture.

In my Legal Research, Writing, and Advocacy course, our assignments are focused on contract law in the context of employment relationships.  Throughout this past semester, I have been researching and writing about issues in this realm.  Specifically, I have produced detailed written work on multi-part offers and acceptance, just cause for dismissal, wrongful termination, and fresh consideration.  Knowledge of the law in these areas as well as experience drafting memos, noting up case law, and accurately attributing authorities for various legal propositions will support my success at an externship in this area of law.  I believe that practical exposure to Labour and Employment Law would be invaluable to broaden my understanding of concepts that I am learning about in the classroom.                                                                                                                    ",,"Since beginning law school, I have become interested in pursuing a career in business law.  I have elected to take Corporate Law next semester to develop a more critical understanding of the role of Canadian business enterprises early on in my law school education.  This course will permit me to enrol in advanced corporate law courses (e.g. Securities Regulations) in my second year and readily approach a summer internship in business law.  By grounding myself in the fundamentals of corporate law, I aim to strategically position myself for success in these critical areas, ensuring that I am well-equipped to meaningfully contribute to a business law practice this upcoming summer.

Additionally, I have participated in extracurricular opportunities in the business law space to pursue knowledge in practice areas that most interest me.  For example, I recently attended an event hosted by the Western Venture Law Society at DLA Piper where I had the opportunity to converse with Partners about securities and corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, financial services and private equity, as well as venture capital matters.  This experience not only reinforced my interest in these practice areas but also provided me with invaluable insights into the legal intricacies that drive business decisions.

In my Legal Research, Writing, and Advocacy course, our assignments are focused on employment contracts and thus, I have been researching and writing about issues in this realm.  Businesses have been the subject of much of my research in cases where employers fail to successfully abide by employment contract law.  This has included topics such as multi-part offers and acceptance, just cause for dismissal, wrongful termination, and fresh consideration.  I believe that practical exposure to labour and employment law on the legal management side would be invaluable while broadening my understanding of business law more generally. 
                                                                                                                                                                ","In my academic studies, I have actively explored the complexities of Intellectual Property Law, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights.  Through my coursework, I have developed a strong foundation in the legal concepts that underpin intellectual property protection, both at common law and in Canadian legislation. I am particularly curious about how intellectual property laws are adapting to new challenges such as digital piracy and works created with artificial intelligence.  These are critical issues that continue to evolve in tandem with technological advancements and require nuanced legal solutions.  I am excited by the idea of helping individuals and companies protect their intellectual property rights.  Contributing to both the protection and incentivisation of new ideas excites me. 
                                       
An externship in Intellectual Property Law would provide me with an invaluable opportunity to practice the skills that I have explored in my study of Property law and thus deepen my understanding of its real-world applications.

This passion is driven by my fatherâs experience as an elementary school music teacher with hearing loss. Witnessing the barriers he faced in securing workplace accommodations, I became acutely aware of the importance of legal protections for disabled individuals. 

My desire to become a disability advocate was strengthened during my summer employment at McDonald Simon LLP. Working closely with a client suffering from a traumatic brain injury, I learned the importance of adapting communication methods to serve individuals with disabilities. This experience taught me to defer to the expertise of disabled individuals regarding what accommodations work best for them, and to ensure that legal strategies align with their needs and preferences. 

Inspired by my fatherâs challenges and my summer work experience, I attended a guest lecture by leading Canadian disability scholar, M. David Lepofsky, this fall at Western Law. This discussion deepened my understanding of the duty to accommodate and solidified my desire to become a disability advocate. I remain enthralled by M. Lepofskyâs work on improving accessibility in educational and professional contexts. 

My commitment to disability advocacy is informed by an appreciation for intersectionality. I recognize that disabled identities intersect with many other identity markers, such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status. This awareness compels me to serve as a dedicated ally to all marginalized groups fighting for recognition of their human rights. ","My interest in private law was ignited during my two summers at McDonald Simon LLP, where I worked closely with experienced civil attorneys. Observing and assisting the work of Mark Simon, Shawn Stewart, and Atef Latif, I gained valuable insights into the practical realities of civil litigation.

At McDonald Simon, I researched an array of private law issues, such as private nuisance, property line disputes, trespass, adverse possession, unjust enrichment, defamation, and anti-SLAPP motions. I learned not only about the formalities of litigating such issues but also about the significant impact they have on individual lives. This exposure provided me with an invaluable primer in legal analysis and a practical introduction to civil law. 

My first semester of law school has reinforced and refined my interest in civil law. I have become especially fascinated by the law of negligence. To me, this area raises the endlessly intriguing question of when human error becomes legally actionable. When, in other words, can the state compel private individuals to pay for their mistakes?

I am learning that the law provides no single answer. The threshold is always shifting. As I progress in my legal career, I hope to continue exploring how the law of negligence balances a recognition of the human tendency to err against the imperative to compensate undue suffering.",,"During my M.A. studies, I undertook a reading course on climate change literature. The course, aptly entitled âReading the Anthropocene,â introduced me to speech act theory â the idea that language does more than describe or represent the world; words can also perform actions. This concept transformed my mode of engaging with literature. I no longer just considered the meaning of a given passage or sentence. Instead, I asked myself, âwhat does this sentence do?â

It was 2023, and wildfire smoke filled the air. The world seemed beyond saving, but speech act theory gave me hope. Studying works like The Great Derangement by Amitav Ghosh and The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells, I became excited about the role of language in responding to environmental crisis. These texts do far more than lament or analyze ecological degradation. They mobilize action, raise awareness, and provoke response. 

My excitement about the power of words animates my desire to pursue environmental law. As a first-year law student, I have discovered that legal language epitomizes speech act theory. In law, language does not just describe; it compels, prohibits, and protects. As I progress in my legal career, I hope to use the power of words to advocate for policies that mitigate environmental harm and address the challenges of Anthropocene living.","My interest in employment law stems from my Legal Research, Writing, and Advocacy course, in which I encountered landmark labour disputes such as McKinley v. BC Tel and Machtinger v. Hoj Industries Ltd. These cases illustrate the uniquely vulnerable bargaining positions employees occupy and their consequent need for robust legal protections. 

Engaging with wrongful dismissal jurisprudence in my coursework, I developed a strong curiosity about employment agreements. Like any contract, such agreements distribute rights and obligations between parties. However, employment agreements are unique because they also delineate the balance of power in the workplace. 

With a background in English Literature, I am especially fascinated by the role of technical language in such contracts. Engaging with employment cases has shown me that language, in labour contexts, is not just descriptive â it constructs and perpetuates the status quo. I am interested in how contractual language can tilt the balance of power in favour of the employee. As I progress in my legal career, I aim to enhance my understanding of the human stories behind employment disputes. I hope to harness the power of legal language in crafting agreements that challenge the status quo and protect employee welfare.","I am interested in pursuing a career in family law because of my passion for advocating for childrenâs rights. In particular, I hope to champion the rights of children who are disabled or otherwise marginalized.  

My passion for youth advocacy first emerged while running a summer music camp during my undergraduate years. This initiative permitted me to develop skills in mentoring and conflict resolution while cultivating a genuine passion for helping children flourish.  

I possess a B.A. in English and French Literature from Brescia University College and a M.A. in English Literature from Western University. This academic background has given me an acute awareness of the human narratives behind every legal dispute. Thus, I believe I am well-equipped to approach family law cases with empathy, insight, and respect for each clientâs story. 

Last summer, I worked closely with a family lawyer at McDonald Simon LLP. In this role, I encountered diverse matrimonial and custody matters. Observing my mentor navigate sensitive disputes and advocate for childrenâs best interests reaffirmed my belief that family law is a powerful avenue for protecting societyâs most vulnerable. 

Overall, I aim to advocate for healthy and equitable resolutions to family disputes wherever possible. I believe that my strong communication skills, empathetic perspective, and dedication to social justice make me a strong candidate for an externship in family law.

While studying law, Iâve been particularly drawn to analyzing frameworks of discrimination and justice, such as those in the Sharma decision. These cases raise critical questions about balancing legislative objectives with equity and fairness, principles that resonate deeply with me. This intellectual curiosity about how international legal systems approach similar issues motivates me to explore transnational challenges and solutions.

Professionally, I developed critical skills as an Account Executive at Enable, where I managed competing priorities and cultivated solutions for diverse clients. These experiences honed my ability to assess nuanced issues, effectively communicate, and adapt to unique stakeholder needs. Leading a team of business development representatives taught me the importance of collaboration and mentorship, values central to my legal aspirations. In an international legal context, these skills translate to analyzing intricate legal scenarios, fostering cross-cultural dialogue, and crafting practical solutions.

My commitment to understanding and addressing systemic inequalities aligns with my long-term career vision: advancing global justice through international law. Whether tackling discrimination through policy work, contributing to academic discourse, or advocating for equitable solutions, I aim to apply my legal training to benefit those impacted by unjust systems.

In addition to professional competencies, my leadership roles, such as being Section Director at Camp Hurontario, have deepened my appreciation for collective goals and diverse perspectives. My lived experiences, including navigating challenges in academia and professional life, offer me a unique lens to understand the importance of inclusive legal systems.

An International Law Externship would provide a platform to deepen my understanding of global legal practices while contributing meaningfully to your work.

Growing up, I spent summers canoeing and exploring natural landscapes, fostering a deep appreciation for preserving these environments. This connection has evolved into a professional aspiration to contribute to environmental advocacy and policymaking. Studying constitutional law and grappling with frameworks like those in the Sharma decision have sharpened my understanding of how legal principles intersect with broader societal goals, inspiring me to explore how these ideas apply to environmental justice.

Professionally, my experience as an Account Executive at Enable taught me the importance of balancing competing priorities and addressing client-specific challenges. Managing relationships with stakeholders while resolving technical issues required thoughtful communication, attention to detail, and a problem-solving mindset. These skills are directly transferable to environmental law. Environmental issues often involve complex, multifaceted disputes requiring collaboration with diverse groups, and my ability to foster relationships and drive solutions positions me to excel in this field.

My vision for a career in environmental law centers on advocating for sustainable practices and policies that mitigate harm to vulnerable ecosystems and communities. I am particularly interested in the role of international treaties and domestic legislation in combating climate change and promoting environmental equity. Questions about balancing economic growth with ecological preservation intrigue me, and I hope to explore solutions that are both innovative and practical.

Beyond my professional skills, my leadership roles at Camp Hurontario and with student organizations like the Western Venture Law Society reflect my dedication to teamwork and commitment to causes larger than myself. My perspective, shaped by years of connecting with nature and working in collaborative environments, equips me to approach environmental legal work with empathy, creativity, and resolve.

An Environmental Law Externship aligns perfectly with my academic interests, professional skills, and personal values. I am eager to contribute meaningfully to your organizationâs efforts while gaining hands-on experience that will shape my future advocacy for environmental justice. Thank you for considering my application.","My interest in labour and employment law arises from my passion for understanding the legal frameworks that govern workplace rights and dynamics. Studying constitutional law has deepened my appreciation for how legal systems shape fairness and equity in our lives, particularly in the workplace. Decisions like Sharma underscore the importance of carefully balancing individual rights with systemic structures, a balance that resonates strongly with the principles of labour and employment law. This area of law appeals to my curiosity about how legal mechanisms can promote inclusive, equitable environments while addressing challenges such as discrimination, workplace safety, and fair treatment.

Professionally, my time as an Account Executive at Enable provided valuable insights into navigating complex interpersonal and organizational relationships. Working with diverse stakeholders, I learned how to adapt my communication style to address challenges effectively and reach mutually beneficial outcomes. These experiences sharpened my ability to handle delicate issues and collaborate constructively, skills that are essential in labour and employment law where disputes often involve deeply personal and nuanced matters. Additionally, leading a team of business development representatives helped me appreciate the importance of fostering a positive, productive team environment.

My long-term goal is to advocate for equitable workplace practices that respect the dignity and rights of all employees while balancing the needs of organizations. I am particularly interested in exploring how labour law intersects with emerging issues such as remote work, workplace diversity, and the rights of gig economy workers. These evolving challenges align with my interest in creating adaptable and forward-thinking legal solutions.

Beyond my professional experience, my leadership roles at Camp Hurontario and involvement in student organizations reflect my commitment to fostering community and addressing group challenges. My experiences navigating teamwork, mentoring others, and resolving conflicts provide a unique perspective on the importance of equitable and inclusive leadership.

An Externship in Labour and Employment Law aligns with my academic, professional, and personal interests. It presents an exciting opportunity to develop expertise in a field that I am deeply passionate about while contributing meaningfully to the legal professionâs role in shaping fair and inclusive workplaces. Thank you for considering my application.","My interest in family law is rooted in a deep commitment to advocating for fairness and equity in the most personal and impactful areas of peopleâs lives. My academic study of constitutional law has highlighted how legal principles shape and protect fundamental rights, particularly within families and communities. Engaging with cases like Sharma has inspired me to explore how legal systems can address systemic inequalities while balancing diverse and often competing interests, an essential consideration in family law. This area of law intrigues me because it combines a focus on individual well-being with the challenge of resolving complex interpersonal and societal issues.

Professionally, my work as an Account Executive at Enable provided me with extensive experience in understanding and addressing individual needs within a broader framework. Balancing the expectations of multiple stakeholders taught me how to navigate sensitive situations with empathy and clarity, a skill critical in family law where emotions and personal stakes often run high. Additionally, managing and mentoring a team strengthened my ability to build trust and communicate effectively, skills I look forward to applying in a family law context.

My long-term career goal is to empower families by advocating for solutions that support stability, equity, and well-being. I am particularly drawn to the intersection of family law and access to justice, as I believe that legal systems must remain accessible to those most in need of their protections. Questions about how to balance individual autonomy with collective familial interests, especially in the context of divorce, custody, and support, motivate me to pursue deeper exploration in this area.

Beyond my professional and academic background, my leadership roles at Camp Hurontario and in student organizations have fostered my commitment to community and collaboration. These experiences, combined with my passion for fairness and my ability to work constructively in challenging situations, give me a unique perspective that I bring to family law.

A Family Law Externship represents an exciting opportunity to deepen my understanding of this vital field while contributing meaningfully to its practice. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your organization.","My interest in business law stems from my professional background in fast-paced, client-focused environments where teamwork and efficiency were critical to success. Through my experiences at Enable, a unicorn SaaS startup, I developed a strong foundation in managing complex tasks, building client relationships, and collaborating within a team, all of which have prepared me to thrive in the dynamic world of business law.

At Enable, I excelled in delivering multiple tasks in a business-like manner while balancing competing priorities. As an Account Executive, I designed and executed sequenced sales campaigns to improve efficiency in business development while maintaining strong relationships with existing clients. This role required me to adopt a structured approach to time management, balancing the demands of new business opportunities with ongoing client engagement. My ability to meet targets while staying organized and professional under pressure mirrors the demands of a business law practice, where precision and timeliness are essential.

In addition to my organizational skills, I bring substantial client-facing experience that has refined my ability to communicate effectively and adapt to diverse challenges. I regularly led meetings with stakeholders to uncover core business challenges and present tailored solutions. This required me to ask thoughtful questions, listen actively, and respond with clear, actionable advice. These experiences taught me the importance of building trust and delivering value to clients, a skill set I am eager to apply in a business law context.

Finally, my success has always been grounded in my ability to collaborate effectively as part of a team. Whether mentoring a group of business development representatives at Enable or contributing to collective goals as a leader at Camp Hurontario, I have consistently sought to build strong relationships and foster a positive team dynamic. I believe this collaborative mindset is vital in business law, where achieving client objectives often requires coordination and mutual support among colleagues.

A Business Law Externship offers an opportunity to build on these skills while gaining hands-on experience in a field that aligns with my professional strengths and interests. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to your team.

How one's social, economic, environmental, and personal factors play a significant role in their access, quality, and effort of care available is pervasive throughout our system. I am a firm believer that individuals should be able to access resources vital to success in their given situation without fear of the inability to afford such resources or that prejudice from those they are seeking help from results in a worse experience. These discussions were incredibly important to have, and ignited a frustrated passion for trying to improve access to such services in a welcoming environment. This pushed me to engage in volunteer opportunities centered around providing high quality health services to underserved communities, particularly for those with mental and physical disabilities. I would like to continue to engage in these kinds of opportunities wherein I can now apply my legal education to assist individuals with a wide variety of social justice concerns. 

One personal experience that really drives my interest in social justice concerns came in the summer following the final year of my undergraduate degree. At the time, I had to deal with an illegal eviction by one of the multi-home student rental landlords in the Hamilton area. This was an incredibly troubling experience and caused an immense amount of stress at the time. I understood that what was occurring was against the law but access to affordable legal counsel given the severity of the issue was not really available within my area. Because of this I was forced to live with friends and commute over an hour each way for work. This really ignited a passion for landlord-tenant disputes in particular.",,"International law is fascinating to me because it sits at the intersection of governance, culture,
and the natural environment and helps to provide a framework for cooperation across
diverse nations. As part of my undergraduate education, I completed a minor in geography
and earth science with a strong emphasis on international relations and culture, which really
helped develop my appreciation for the global forces that shape legal systems and human
interactions. Through the geography core of my minor, I explored how physical and human
landscapes influence global dynamics. I believe that exploring how international law addresses
transboundary challenges like climate change, resource management, and biodiversity
conservation would be incredibly interesting to pair with my more physical and sociological
background on the topic. The overlap between natural systems and legal frameworks like the
Paris agreement resonates with my studies, as it demonstrates the need for law to be both
adaptable and inclusive of scientific realities. My focus on culture and international relations,
while on a more surface level, highlighted how legal systems mediate between different
values, traditions, and priorities. International law acts as a bridge, striving to create
consensus while respecting diversity (between communities engaging in international law in a
positive way). Whether it's human rights conventions or trade agreements, these frameworks
underscore the importance of dialogue and collaboration in resolving disputes and fostering
global stability. What I also find exciting about international law is its ability to evolve in
response to new global challenges. The fieldâs dynamic nature reflects the shifting realities of
geopolitics, technological advancements, and environmental change. My studies have instilled
in me a curiosity about how legal principles can adapt to address these challenges.",,,,"Business, and particularly the navigating of relationships associated in the creation,
maintenance and success of a business has become a keen interest of mine through my
education and I believe the SA1L program is a fantastic opportunity to gain a deeper
understanding of this process and develop my legal education in a real-world environment. I
believe that my significant experience in client-facing roles across a variety of fields will serve
me well in business law. In particular, my time as a site lead while working in landscaping
allowed me to develop my communicative abilities with demanding clients, practice managing
client expectations, and work through conflict both from a service provider and service
receiver perspective. Often I would find myself as the sole representative of the business for
the client, and this forced me to think creatively and develop professional relationships selfsufficiently. Occasionally, these discussions were elevated due to the nature of the job, with
some multiple 6 figure contracts with extremely particular clients. In these cases, I would often
have to coordinate expectations, needs and deadlines across 2 or more parties in a timely
manner. This practice in efficient and forward communication between multiple parties
should serve me well in business law. While not specifically business-focussed, I believe that
my graduate education has bolstered this foundation in client dealings. Much of my
coursework was focused on effective communication and education of clients. Additionally, I
spent significant time learning about efficient multi-disciplinary teamwork and how to access
and understand policy implemented by governing bodies, which may prove particularly useful
depending on the context of the business a given client is engaging in. Finally, I understand
that a significant number of legal issues are navigated out of court and while I had been able
to foster dispute resolution skills in previous work, my education through the Dispute
Resolution Centre at Western has given me the opportunity to do so on a more technical level.
I believe the discussion navigation skills and understanding of negotiation techniques will
benefit me greatly in representing clients across various alternative dispute resolution
modalities.","My interest in intellectual property law was really sparked by my experience in Japan in my
grade 11 summer when representing Canada at RoboCup Junior (an international robotics
competition where we effectively made roomba-looking robots that played soccer). While
there, I became aware of the fact that Japan had no fair-use legal framework, which helped
explain why later that year, there was a significant crackdown on Nintendo content on
platforms like YouTube because of how litigious the company can be in protecting their IP. As I
moved through my science education, I really began to understand the significance of this
field of law as even though science is inherently collaborative, it requires a delicate balance
between sharing ideas and safeguarding the rights of creators. During my studies, I
encountered numerous examples of inventive work in fields like biotechnology, exercise
science and pharmacology, all of which depend on robust IP laws to foster innovation while
ensuring fair recognition and reward for inventors. This is particularly intriguing for me as
intellectual property law operates at the intersection of science, law, and business. I am also
incredibly interested in IP law as it is in a particularly challenging position at the moment and
moving forward given the substantial rise of AI into all fields, but particularly science and
entertainment. How the jurisprudence adapts to these innovations has the potential to be
monumentally influential in all areas of life from employment to sports and the possible
opportunity to be involved in some capacity in that journey is quite exciting.",183998.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_1F2l0i1cUP3Rj0a,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_UucYLETgEz9DWjn,,,,,,,,,,,

During my volunteer work with the Canadian Mental Health Association, I offered mental health support vulnerable individuals, which exposed me to the systemic barriers that many face when accessing health services. This experience inspired me to explore the legal mechanisms that can combat discrimination and promote inclusivity. I am particularly curious about the intersection of mental health and human rights law. Issues such as access to mental health services and protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities are topics I am eager to delve into further.

As well, throughout my time as a research assistant at Victoria Hospital, I have been involved in projects that aimed to improve access to healthcare for vulnerable populations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I helped ensure early access to vaccinations for immunocompromised patients. I have also participated in studies aimed at reducing re-admission rates by providing patient education, and on patient transportation for individuals in rural and remote settings, which have reinforced my belief in the power of practical, systemic interventions. My experiences have shaped my adaptability and curiosity, enabling me to approach complex societal challenges with empathy and ingenuity.","My passion for social justice and human rights law stems from a deep-seated belief in the power of advocacy to drive meaningful change. Through my volunteer work with the Canadian Mental Health Association, I witnessed the barriers that marginalized communities face in accessing essential services. Providing support to individuals struggling with mental health challenges during moments of crisis emphasized the need for legal and systemic advocacy to bridge these gaps. I saw how advocacy could create tangible change not just for individuals, but for entire communities.  

As a research assistant at Victoria Hospital, I was involved in projects aimed at improving healthcare access for underserved populations, from ensuring early COVID-19 vaccination for immunocompromised patients to exploring solutions for rural healthcare disparities. These experiences underscored how systemic inequities impact vulnerable populations and reaffirmed my desire to advocate for comprehensive policy reforms that address such issues at their root. I am particularly passionate about advancing human rights in areas where marginalized groups are disproportionately affected, such as mental health, disability rights, and access to justice. Advocacy in these areas aligns with my belief that the law should serve as a shield for the vulnerable. My diverse experiences have provided me with a unique perspective on the challenges faced by diverse communities. I would like to use my experiences to connect with individuals from various walks of life and advocate effectively on their behalf.",,,"I have always been concerned by the widespread denial of climate change. Despite overwhelming scientific evidence, climate change remains one of the most polarizing and misunderstood issues of our time. This disconnect between evidence and action has always baffled me, particularly given the profound and far-reaching consequences of inaction. Climate change is not just an environmental issue; it is a social, economic, and political crisis that impacts every facet of our lives. Yet, denial and inaction persist at alarming levels, driven by misinformation, corporate interests, and short-term thinking. This indifference fuels my desire to make a meaningful change. I want to work toward bridging the gap between evidence and policy, ensuring that the science of climate change is translated into actionable legal and regulatory frameworks.

Environmental law provides a unique opportunity to address the complexities of environmental legislation and its enforcement, holding polluters accountable, shaping sustainable policies, and advocating for marginalized communities who disproportionately bear the brunt of climate change. 

My background in medical science equips me with a strong understanding of the environmental determinants of health, while my business studies have taught me to assess the economic implications of environmental policies.

I learnt to build and maintain trusting relationships with industry mentors and potential investors, and take ownership of my work, which enhanced my ability to navigate complex discussions and establish credibility. Working with an early-stage business deepened my understanding of the operational challenges faced by startups and underscored the importance of strategic planning and relationship-building in driving a businessâs success.

Through working with employment agencies in my earlier working years, I witnessed firsthand the struggles faced by marginalized communities and the inequality that often governs access to resources, opportunities, and justice. These experiences instilled in me a desire to fight for those who are often silenced or overlooked.

Through my education and work experience, I have become increasingly aware of the systemic barriers that disproportionately impact individuals based on race, socioeconomic status, gender, and other aspects of identity. I want to be part of the solution by using the law to advocate for these communities, ensuring they receive fair treatment and access to their fundamental rights. The intersection of law and human rights offers a powerful platform to challenge oppression, discrimination, and exploitation, and I am committed to contributing to this cause.

Human rights law, in particular, interests me because of my diverse educational background. With an undergraduate degree in psychology, as well as working experience in the world of psychology, the impact of human rights issues is something I have become increasingly familiar with.

I believe that employment law is essential in creating balanced and supportive work environments where employees are treated with dignity and respect while employers can maintain productive and efficient organizations.

Employment law encompasses a wide range of issues, including discrimination, wage and hour laws, workplace safety, and wrongful termination. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to use legal frameworks to protect employees from unfair treatment and to advocate for policies that promote equity and inclusion in the workplace.

I am excited about the prospect of navigating these complexities and contributing to the development of laws that address both emerging challenges and longstanding injustices.

By combining my analytical skills and passion for business, I am committed to helping companies achieve their goals while operating within the bounds of the law.","I am deeply motivated to pursue a career in intellectual property (IP) law because of my fascination with the intersection of innovation, creativity, and legal protection. Throughout my undergraduate studies in psychology, I developed a strong understanding of human cognition, behavior, and the creative process, which sparked my interest in how intellectual property law safeguards the rights of creators and innovators. I believe that IP law plays a crucial role in fostering innovation by ensuring that individuals and businesses can protect and monetize their ideas, inventions, and artistic works.

IP law is essential for striking a balance between encouraging innovation and ensuring that knowledge and creativity can be shared for the public good. Whether it is patent law protecting technological advancements, copyright law safeguarding creative works, or trademark law ensuring brand identity, IP law provides a vital framework for promoting and protecting intellectual capital. I am particularly drawn to the challenge of navigating the complexities of these legal systems to ensure that the rights of creators are properly upheld while promoting fair competition and access to knowledge.

My academic background in psychology has also helped me appreciate the broader societal impacts of IP law, particularly in understanding how individuals and organizations perceive and interact with intellectual property. The legal mechanisms behind IP protection are not just about enforcing rights; they also shape how innovation is encouraged, how businesses grow, and how society benefits from new ideas. I am eager to apply my skills in research, analysis, and problem-solving to IP law, and to advocate for policies and legal solutions that foster an environment where creativity and innovation can thrive.

I am excited about the opportunity to work at the cutting edge of IP law, where the rapid pace of technological and creative advancements provides constant challenges and opportunities for growth. My goal is to contribute to the protection and promotion of intellectual property rights, helping to ensure that innovation continues to drive progress in society.

This experience highlighted the intersectionality of social issues such as disability, homelessness, and poverty and how these issues create significant barriers to equal access to justice at the London Courthouse for all justice system participants. 

Despite my efforts, the complexity of the legal system often left individuals with questions I was unable to answer, as they fell under the scope of legal advice. While I was able to address simpler inquiries during my two and a half years in this role, the inability to fully support these individuals underscored the systemic inequities they encounter. This deepened my interest in justice reform, particularly in public law. 

Through this experience, I also developed key transferable skills in conflict resolution and empathy. Interacting with individuals facing significant challenges required patience, active listening, and the ability to de-escalate emotionally charged situations. These skills have enabled me to effectively manage difficult conversations while providing reassurance and clarity during stressful legal proceedings. I believe these abilities will be invaluable in my legal career, especially in the public law field, where understanding and resolving conflicts with empathy is crucial to creating fair and equitable outcomes. 

Working closely with individuals navigating the justice system also illuminated the emotional toll of legal challenges. Many were overwhelmed not only by their circumstances but also by the procedural and linguistic hurdles inherent in accessing justice. I saw how these barriers disproportionately impact marginalized populations, reinforcing cycles of disadvantage. This aligns with my passion for pursuing a legal career in public law and policy reform, where I aim to create systemic solutions that bridge the gap between legal principles and lived realities. My vision is to develop legal frameworks and advocacy initiatives that prioritize accessibility, equity, and empowerment for underserved communities, ensuring justice is a tangible right for all and not just for those who can afford it.
","Working at the courthouse has given me a unique perspective on the intersection of the legal system, social justice, and human rights law. In my role, Iâve interacted with individuals from diverse backgrounds, many of whom face systemic barriers such as poverty, mental health issues, or discrimination. These challenges often place them at a disadvantage when navigating the court system, where access to justice is not always equally distributed.

I have witnessed how these social issues disproportionately affect marginalized communities, especially when individuals are unable to access the resources or legal representation needed to effectively participate in their cases. This reinforces the need for a legal system that not only provides fair proceedings but also recognizes the social factors that contribute to legal challenges. It became clear to me that human rights law must address these inequalities to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity for justice, regardless of their socio-economic status, race, or background.

Moreover, my experience has made me aware of how often the law, as it stands, fails to account for the complex realities that many individuals face. Iâve seen how individuals with limited resources, especially those facing mental health or addiction issues, are treated by the system in ways that undermine their fundamental human rights, such as the right to fair treatment and access to legal counsel. This has deepened my understanding of how human rights law can be a tool for challenging such injustices and advocating for systemic change that promotes equity and fairness.

In short, my courthouse experience has strengthened my commitment to social justice and human rights law, as Iâve gained a deeper understanding of how the law can either perpetuate or challenge societal inequalities. I am motivated to pursue a career that advocates for a more inclusive and compassionate legal system, one that upholds the rights of all individuals and addresses the underlying social issues that contribute to legal challenges.
","During my time at the courthouse filing civil paperwork, I gained invaluable insight into the operations of civil law, which greatly fueled my interest in the field. Assisting with the filing process provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the Rules of Civil Procedure and their application at each stage of a civil case. From the initial Statement of Claim or Notice of Application to the final judgment, this exposure deepened my appreciation of how the legal system resolves private disputes and navigates the complexities of achieving fair outcomes.

A particularly impactful aspect of my experience was observing pre-trial conferences, where judges facilitate settlements before the case proceeds to trial. These conferences highlighted the significance of negotiation, compromise, and alternative dispute resolution in civil law. I was struck by how a judgeâs involvement could encourage parties to find mutually beneficial solutions, ultimately saving both time and resources for the court system and the individuals involved. This experience sparked my interest in private law, where negotiation and settlement play an essential role in efficiently resolving disputes without the need for lengthy trials.

Through this experience, I also developed valuable, transferable skills that will support my legal career. I came to realize that the adversarial nature of court does not always need to be divisive. Instead, I learned to approach conflict resolution with a balanced perspective, recognizing the importance of understanding both sides and working toward fair and equitable solutions. Additionally, I honed my communication, organizational, and time management skills while assisting with legal documentation and procedural requirements, while also strengthening my attention to detail, accuracy, and ability to manage multiple tasks at once.

Overall, my courthouse experience has significantly shaped my passion for civil law. Observing the practical application of legal principles, coupled with my exposure to settlement processes during pre-trial conferences, has solidified my aspiration to pursue a career in civil and private law.
","My law school experiences, combined with my undergraduate degree in political science, have profoundly shaped my interest in international law. During my political science studies, I took a course in international politics, where I participated in a research project simulating a cabinet meeting, representing the Department of Defence. In this role, I conducted research and presented our departmentâs response to an international crisis. This project gave me a deeper understanding of the complexities of international negotiations, diplomacy, and decision-making processes.

Although I have not yet taken a formal international law course, my legal studies have sparked a fascination with how domestic law intersects with global issues. For example, through constitutional law, I have examined the legal frameworks that shape international obligations. These courses have heightened my interest in how law addresses global challenges such as human rights violations, climate change, and cross-border conflicts.

Additionally, my background in international politics has underscored the critical role of collaboration between nations and international organizations in developing legal frameworks to tackle global issues. My experience in the mock cabinet meeting provided insight into the negotiation and diplomatic processes that shape international treaties and agreements.

This experience also helped me develop transferable skills in research, critical thinking, communication, and negotiation. These competencies will be invaluable as I navigate the complex legal and diplomatic landscape, where effective negotiation and collaboration are crucial for resolving global disputes and shaping policy.

In sum, my political science background, particularly my research project in international politics, has fueled my passion for international law. My legal studies have expanded my understanding of how domestic and international legal systems intersect, strengthening my resolve to pursue a career in international law and global policy development.
",,,"My parents' divorce, coupled with my time working at the courthouse, has significantly shaped my interest in family law. Witnessing the emotional and legal challenges my parents faced during their separation provided me with a deep understanding of the complexities involved in family law matters. I saw how the legal system could serve as both a source of resolution and a cause of added stress for those navigating it, particularly in emotionally charged situations.

While working at the courthouse, I observed numerous self-represented individuals struggling to understand court procedures, legal forms, and family law issues such as custody, child support, and spousal support. Many of these individuals faced financial difficulties, which exacerbated their inability to access necessary legal assistance. This experience illuminated the significant gaps in the system and the disproportionate impact these gaps have on vulnerable populations. It became clear to me that effective legal representation is critical, and that individuals need access to the proper tools and resources to navigate the complexities of family law.

When you consider the high stakes involved in family law matters issues such as child custody and support, and division of assets, it raises serious concerns about the consequences of individuals being ill-equipped to navigate these matters. This reality fueled my desire to pursue family law, as I became passionate about advocating for individuals who are navigating some of lifeâs most challenging and important issues without full understanding or proper support.

Both my personal experiences and my work at the courthouse have inspired me to pursue a career in family law. I am particularly drawn to the challenge of balancing the interests of all parties while addressing the emotional, financial, and legal concerns at play. My goal is to provide compassionate legal support to those who need it most, ensuring that the legal system remains accessible to all, regardless of financial or personal challenges.

If I saw a person who was ill or living on the streets, I would think about them for days, wishing I could resolve their situation. After working at a child advocacy centre, I learned about the unjust nature of the world, in how systemic barriers impact at-risk individuals and underrepresented communities. I felt compelled to help others, and thus sought volunteer and mentorship opportunities during my undergraduate studies. Through my sorority, I organized fundraising events for philanthropic organizations and volunteered for Meals on Wheels. In my program, I was our Student Associationâs Mentorship Coordinator, where I provided academic guidance and resources for student success. I also sat on the programâs Anti-Racism Committee, which aimed to create a more equitable space on campus through diversification, advocacy, and giving students a platform to voice their concerns. 

In these roles, I interacted with people in vulnerable situations, including domestic violence victims, students struggling mentally and financially, and people facing racism. I learned how to listen attentively, ask appropriate questions, understand oneâs position, and validate oneâs experiences while maintaining professionalism, and have had the opportunity to further develop these interpersonal skills at Western Law. As an associate caseworker at Community Legal Services (CLS), I have employed the same compassionate, empathetic approach during client interactions. As a volunteer with Pro Bono Students Canada for Project Consent, I had to answer difficult questions when leading public legal education presentations that teach high school students about consent, sexual assault, and their options if they are a victim of these crimes. 

My overall experience has taught me the importance of service and outreach, in how a small action can have a lasting impact, and I strongly believe that those of us entering the legal profession have a duty to help those in need. I have strong communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills, and am dedicated to increasing access to justice by advocating for those who need their voices heard and amplified. It would therefore be an honour to further my experience in the public interest sector this summer.",,"I am curious about exploring areas of private and civil law. Through my coursework, I have studied contracts, torts, and property law, all of which I have found intriguing and relatively easy to grasp. I also gained considerable experience in the private sector, having worked in the insurance and finance industries. These have provided me with critical thinking skills, as well as the ability to analyze complex legal issues in a clear and concise manner. My position as an associate caseworker with Community Legal Services (CLS) has allowed me to explore civil law, reinforcing my interest in this area of practice. I had the opportunity to assist an upper year student with a case and enjoyed attending Small Claims Court as an observer. I then filled out court order forms, including a Writ of Seizure and Sale of Land and an Affidavit for Enforcement Request. I found myself actively engaging with the matter by asking questions and trying to understand the documents. Furthermore, I demonstrated attention to detail by spotting errors and readjusting calculations accordingly. 
In terms of my personal values, I believe every person should be entitled to basic human rights. Thus, I have always been fascinated with the Canadian Constitution, more specifically the Charter. I noticed that one of the organizations listed in this category was the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, which seeks to protect and promote the human rights, civil liberties, and democratic freedoms of persons in Canada. I believe a huge part of doing so involves educating others on their rights and freedoms. This is why I was thrilled to volunteer with Pro Bono Students Canada for Project Consent, which informs high school students on their rights and legal options for victims of sexual violence. I am also a member of the Christian Legal Fellowship, which similarly aims to advance justice by promoting fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of religion. I am a justice seeking individual, dedicated to breaking down systemic barriers. This, combined with my strong oral and written communication, research, and advocacy skills would enable me to thrive in a private/civil law environment. ",,,,"I always had a desire to learn about family structures and dynamics. My interest in family law and child protection emerged at a young age during employment at the Boost Child & Youth Advocacy Centre. I felt compelled to pursue an education and career that would allow me to help children and families in vulnerable situations or otherwise difficult periods of their lives. Thus, I attended York University for Children, Childhood & Youth Studies, which implemented an interdisciplinary, human-rights based approach to the study of childhood. Afterwards, I gained two years of administrative experience in business settings. 

At Western Law, I became an associate caseworker for Community Legal Services (CLS) on the family law team and joined the Family Law Studentsâ Association (FLSA). At CLS, I have sat in client intake and retainer meetings, taken notes, and drafted correspondence. I also took initiative by approaching one of the Review Counsel about assisting with a project with the Childrenâs Aid Society. It excites me to be able to gain hands-on, practical experience with real family law matters. Moreover, it feels rewarding to be part of a team that increases access to legal services for low-income families. Through the FLSA, I had the opportunity to expand my network through organizing coffee chats with family lawyers across London and the GTA. By asking about the kind of work they do, what they love most about their job, and the challenges they face, I learned about both the private and child protection sides of family law. As per the advice I received, I plan to take Family Law, Childrenâs Law, and Advanced Clinical Law (Family), as well as other relevant courses in wills, estate planning, tax, and property. Moreover, I will explore extracurricular opportunities such as the Legal Information for Sexual Assault service (LISA) and the Dispute Resolution Centre at Western Law. 

I am passionate about a career in family law and am seeking any opportunity to expand my legal knowledge and experience. This, combined with my strong research and communication skills, makes me a strong candidate for a summer position within the field.","Prior to attending law school, I worked for the family insurance business, where I enrolled employees into their benefits plans, processed health and dental claims, and assisted in developing policies against money laundering and terrorism in compliance with federal laws. Through the latter, I quickly became fascinated with the legal side of business. Following this role, I became a Financial Services Assistant at Assante Capital Management, where I assisted with 75 client tax returns by scanning and digitally filing tax documents and pulling tax slips from several different fund company websites. I was able to balance this with my administrative duties, including managing the phone system and front desk reception, client correspondence, and meeting prep for our Senior Wealth Advisor. In completing the latter, I improved my financial literacy tremendously through generating investment account performance reports, updating financial dashboards on Excel, and creating PowerPoint presentations based on these results. I gained more in-depth knowledge of the financial sector when processing trades through the purchasing, selling, and switching of funds. 

My two years of business experience taught me how to manage my time and handle multiple tasks while conducting myself in an efficient, organized, and focused manner. I also learned the importance of punctuality, active listening, direct communication, and having a professional demeanour, which are vital skills to have in the legal profession. The administrative tasks I carried out require great attention to detail to ensure the utmost accuracy. Moreover, as client service is a priority, I learned how to adapt to constantly changing circumstances. I have dealt with people from all walks of life, including corporations, through which I have witnessed the impact of the law on business institutions, and how advancements in technology can strengthen client service. 

Ultimately, I gained knowledge of how one can impact clientsâ personal lives in profound ways, similar to a legal professional. Whether it be a financial or legal matter, the goal is to represent clients who trust us to provide expert advice, service, and protection. I am therefore eager about the opportunity, and well-equipped to further my experience in a business law setting.","As an individual with extensive arts and business experience, I am curious to explore intellectual property law (IP) as a career path. Throughout my life, I have been exposed to different fields and disciplines, all of which pertain to IP. I am classically trained in piano, guitar, and voice and received an arts education growing up. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted an independent research project that uncovered a new feminist take on a misogynistic fairy tale. My work was published on the programâs website as well as a scholarly resource. I am grateful to have contributed to a relatively new field and advanced my research, analytical, and communication skills through this thesis. Prior to law school, I worked for the family insurance business and in the finance sector, where I acquired strong interpersonal skills through client interactions. 

As an avid performer, writer, and researcher, I am aware of the time and effort that goes into generating ideas and creating works from them. Having directly witnessed the amount of time, money, and effort that goes into starting and running a small business, I gained an appreciation for the entrepreneurial spirit, in how business owners must constantly think of opportunities to improve and expand. I am therefore in a unique position to understand the wants, needs, and struggles of professionals seeking legal advice regarding their intellectual property rights. 

It is inevitable for creators, innovators, and entrepreneurs to want to obtain protection for the expressions of their ideas. In my Property Law course, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about copyright law, which protects the rights of creators of original works by granting them exclusive rights to the reproduction, publishing, and selling of their work. Moreover, I quickly became fascinated with the analysis that is conducted to determine whether a copyright infringement has occurred. I am interested in participating in IP and entertainment law courses, organizations, and moots at Western Law. 

Ultimately, I am seeking an opportunity to gain knowledge and experience in a field where my passion, professional experience, and career goals can intersect, and I believe I can make a valuable contribution.

","Addressing issues of social justice and human rights has been a consistent passion of mine since childhood. I grew up in a low-income, single-parent home, susceptible to witnessing many injustices. Years later, in search of a way to maximize my experiences for good, I enrolled in the Social Justice and Peace Studies program as one of my undergrad majors. Through Social justice, I gained the language to discuss adversity and a solution-focused perspective to take action. Understanding the systems that perpetuate inequities is essential to effectively learn and promote the needs of individuals and groups. I also took a human rights course where I researched the homelessness crisis in London, Ontario. Through interviewing community members (a shelter employee and a homelessness crisis manager for youth at Y.O.U) and extensively following the work of former special rapporteur Leilani Farha, I solidified my passion of advocating for housing. 
Currently, I volunteer as an associate caseworker at the Community Legal Services (CLS) Clinic at Western Law where I learn legal procedures and help clients access justice. Providing those most in need with representation is crucial to the work at CLS and to my goals as a future lawyer.
I am eager to learn the legal processes to bridge the theory of social justice and human rights with the practice of advocating in a legal setting. Justice and human rights are not simple or minor tasks - this I know. Even so, I want to engage and persevere to achieve justice for those suffering without it.

","My interest in private law is rooted in a justice perspective because each individual deserves to have their story heard and personal rights upheld. I am new to contract and property law but am always captivated by these classes. Contracts are relevant in everything we do; understanding the principles and applications is vital to all areas of law. Meanwhile, property law is so prevalent because everything is owned, rented, leased, or possessed by someone at some point. 
Tort law fascinated me before coming to law school, specifically personal injury. My mother-in-law was severely injured by a bouncer (unprovoked) resulting in a concussion and long-lasting impacts on her memory. She remains in court, fighting against the injustice. Through her experience, I gained an appreciation for the advocacy that personal injury lawyers provide to people who require just representation. The stakes are often raised because the impact of injuries can alter someone's life, and without proper damages, likely for the worse. As a volunteer associate caseworker at Community Legal Services (CLS) at Western Law, I have recently conducted an intake for a personal injury case where I was exposed to the reality of private law. A presumably minor infraction to one person may have a more crippling effect on another, requiring action. I understand private law as a mechanism for individuals to mitigate and rectify the injustices that often occur within society. I would be interested in learning about the processes associated with private law because I know how prevalent these principles are when dealing with any dispute between people and groups. 

Thank you,

","Since undergrad, I have held International law on a pedestal because interwoven in each of my social justice and peace studies courses, human rights courses, and political science courses, international organizations regulate and maintain order. From these courses, I am well aware that different cultures exist in contradiction and many co-exist. The importance of international law is advocating for and creating cooperation and stability among societies around the world.
I would be honoured to learn the legal processes associated with regulating international concerns. My ideal future career would be to work as an in-house lawyer for an international or environmental organization, aiding to maintain peace and change public policies. My favourite courses in undergrad were the credits I took toward my law and public policy certificate; each taught me the crucial role public policy plays in shaping the law and creating accessible justice. 
I have yet to take an international law course but will be enrolling next year. To gain the knowledge and skills from an externship would be invaluable to my future career. I have a passion for making a difference in the world and an eagerness for hands-on experience within the field of international law.

","My ideal future career would be within the environmental law field. Since childhood, I have been passionate about environmental issues (cleaning my neighbourhood, planting trees, recycling). Now, as I progress through life, I am certain that being involved in public policy and maintaining environmental laws is what I aspire to do. 
I have researched mining in Canada, climate action in my home city (London, Ontario), composting practices in Ontario, waste management in London, and environmental education in Canadian schools. I began my research in 2017 when the local landfill was nearing capacity. Years later, and more recently, I researched the exclusion of apartment renters from climate action in London through policy analysis, interviews, and surveys. I was later chosen to travel to Notre Dame University and present my findings at the International Peace Conference. I believe that environmental issues (pollution, depleting resources, contaminations, etc), will not subside without action to change the practices that create them - this begins with sound policies and laws to mitigate environmental concerns. 
My involvement in environmental law has been limited to research, which is why I am eager to gain exposure to environmental law in practice. To learn the legal processes and mechanisms of public policy would be invaluable to my future career as a lawyer. I am open to learning about it all!

Having worked extensively with vulnerable populations in clinical research and as a teaching assistant for a mental health and resilience course, Iâve witnessed how systemic barriers exacerbate challenges for individuals navigating healthcare, education, and housing systems. These experiences inspired me to explore how the law can be a tool for justice and advocacy.

One question that fuels my curiosity in this area is: how can the legal system balance efficiency with the need for individualized attention in addressing issues like housing instability or disability rights? The intersection of law and social policy fascinates me, as it offers opportunities to challenge structural inequalities and effect tangible change.

Public interest law aligns with my values of service and advocacy. As someone raised by a strong role model who prioritized helping others, Iâve always been driven to contribute meaningfully to my community. This area of law resonates deeply with my vision of a career where I can amplify marginalized voices and promote systemic reform.

My aspirations in this field include engaging in advocacy and policymaking to address issues such as access to affordable housing and healthcare. My academic background in health sciences, coupled with two years of clinical research experience, equips me with a unique perspective on the social determinants of health. These insights would enhance my ability to tackle multifaceted issues through a legal lens.

Additionally, my skills in critical analysis, stakeholder communication, and empathetic engagement are directly transferable to public interest law. I have cultivated these skills while working with Alzheimerâs patients, experiences that deepened my understanding of vulnerability and resilience.

What sets me apart is my holistic approach to problem-solving, informed by both academic rigor and lived experience. I believe this perspective will enable me to contribute meaningfully to initiatives that seek to address systemic injustices and promote equity.
","My passion for social justice and human rights law is rooted in my academic pursuits and professional exposure to marginalized populations. During my first semester of Western Law, I developed a strong interest in constitutional law and Canadian federalism, which helped me understand the ways legal frameworks shape and perpetuate inequality. This academic foundation, coupled with hands-on work in mental health and clinical research, inspired me to pursue a career focused on advancing equity and justice.
I am deeply curious about how human rights law can bridge gaps in protection for marginalized groups. For example, I often question how Canadian courts can better incorporate international human rights principles into domestic decisions, particularly those affecting Indigenous communities and individuals with disabilities. The dynamic interplay between local and global human rights frameworks fascinates me and motivates me to explore solutions that prioritize equity and inclusion.
This area of law aligns perfectly with my aspiration to engage in impact litigation and systemic reform. I envision working to challenge discriminatory laws and advocating for policy changes that address structural inequities. My work with vulnerable populations, such as Alzheimerâs patients, has taught me the importance of empathy and persistence in advocacy, qualities I believe are essential for success in this field.
My experiences have also equipped me with critical skills, including analytical thinking, effective communication, and stakeholder collaboration. For instance, my research on the legal rights of individuals with Alzheimerâs disease illuminated the complex barriers to healthcare access and long-term care, which are often compounded by overlapping forms of discrimination. These insights have sharpened my ability to analyze multifaceted legal issues and craft innovative solutions.
What makes my perspective unique is my ability to connect lived experiences with legal theory. My interdisciplinary background in health sciences enables me to approach legal challenges from a holistic standpoint, considering both societal and individual implications. I am eager to bring this perspective to the externship, contributing to meaningful efforts that promote social justice and uphold human rights.

",,,"My interest in environmental law was sparked during my undergraduate studies, where I explored the intersections between public health and environmental sustainability. Witnessing the tangible effects of environmental degradation on vulnerable communitiesâsuch as increased respiratory illnesses due to air pollutionâfueled my desire to address these issues through a legal lens.
One question that intrigues me is how environmental law can effectively balance economic growth with the need for sustainability. I am particularly interested in exploring the legal mechanisms that can hold corporations accountable for environmental harm while incentivizing sustainable practices. For instance, how can legislative frameworks better integrate Indigenous perspectives on land stewardship?
Environmental law aligns with my broader goal of pursuing a career that combines advocacy with systemic change. I am motivated by the opportunity to work on cases and policies that have a direct impact on public health and environmental justice. This externship offers a chance to contribute to meaningful work that aligns with my values of sustainability and equity.
My academic and professional experiences have provided me with skills that are directly applicable to this field. For example, my clinical research experience involved analyzing complex data sets and communicating findings to diverse stakeholdersâskills that are invaluable in navigating the multifaceted challenges of environmental law. Additionally, my work with Alzheimerâs patients taught me the importance of empathy and persistence, qualities that are equally essential in advocating for environmental justice.
What distinguishes me is my interdisciplinary perspective. My background in health sciences allows me to approach environmental issues with an understanding of their public health implications, while my legal training equips me to analyze and apply regulatory frameworks. This combination of skills and experiences positions me to contribute uniquely to the field of environmental law, particularly in advocating for policies that promote both ecological sustainability and social equity.
","My interest in labour and employment law stems from my experiences observing the challenges faced by workers in precarious employment situations. As someone who has worked in diverse professional environments, Iâve seen firsthand how power imbalances can affect workplace dynamics and the rights of employees. These experiences sparked my desire to advocate for fair and equitable workplace practices.

One issue that fascinates me is how labour laws can adapt to the evolving nature of work in the gig economy. For example, how can existing frameworks be reformed to ensure that gig workers receive adequate protections and benefits? This question reflects my broader curiosity about the intersection of labour law and social justice.

Labour and employment law align with my values of fairness and equity. I am motivated by the opportunity to contribute to a field that directly impacts individualsâ livelihoods and well-being. My long-term career goal is to engage in advocacy and policy reform to address systemic issues in employment practices, such as wage inequality and workplace harassment.

My academic and professional experiences have equipped me with skills that are directly applicable to this field. For instance, my work as a teaching assistant for a mental health course highlighted the importance of promoting well-being in professional settings. Additionally, my clinical research experience taught me to analyze complex issues and communicate effectively with diverse stakeholders, skills that are invaluable in navigating the intricacies of labour and employment law.

What distinguishes me is my empathetic approach and commitment to understanding the lived experiences of workers. My background in health sciences provides a unique lens through which to examine workplace issues, particularly those related to mental health and well-being. This perspective, combined with my passion for advocacy, positions me to contribute meaningfully to the field of labour and employment law, particularly in advancing policies that promote equitable and inclusive workplaces.",,,"My interest in intellectual property (IP) law began prior to my time at Western Law and has been strengthened from my involvement with a student pro bono IP legal clinic, where I had the opportunity to assist clients in navigating the complexities of protecting their innovations. This experience illuminated the vital role that IP law plays in fostering creativity and economic growth, particularly for small businesses and inventors.

One question that drives my curiosity is how IP law can adapt to the rapid advancements in technology and globalization. For instance, how can international IP frameworks balance protecting creatorsâ rights while ensuring equitable access to knowledge and resources? I am particularly interested in exploring how IP law can support emerging industries, such as renewable energy and biotechnology.

IP law aligns with my long-term career goal of working at the intersection of law, innovation, and public policy. I envision a career where I can help businesses and individuals protect their intellectual assets while promoting ethical practices and innovation. This externship offers a unique opportunity to deepen my understanding of the legal, economic, and societal implications of IP law.

My academic background in health sciences and experience with clinical research provide a strong foundation for understanding technical concepts, which is particularly relevant in IP law.

My post-secondary academic career began in 2019 at Western University. While I ultimately graduated with an HBA Degree from the Ivey Business School, I first studied in the Faculty of Political Science, grounding me with a solid foundation of the structure and processes of Canadaâs political system. The coursework allowed me to refine my research and argument-building skills, especially through essays tackling relevant issues impacting different communities. I prioritized researching topics such as the adverse health disparities faced by Indigenous Peoples due to Canadian Government policies, and the tangible impact of Canadaâs Gender Equality Day on non-binary individuals, because I sought to understand and view life from different perspectives.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, Iâve consistently prioritized making a meaningful impact on the environment, particularly during my time at Nasdaq.

Before starting law school, I worked at Nasdaq as a Marketing Associate, having initially joined as an Intern during my undergraduate studies. In this role, I developed a diverse skill set that was recognized by my team, including my executive presence, research, and writing capabilities. These strengths led to my appointment as the lead copywriter for Nasdaqâs Investment Intelligence Data division, where I worked closely with subject matter experts and the Office of the General Counsel to produce in-depth content for professional investors and institutions. I played a key role in developing product documentation for Nasdaqâs sustainability-related data offerings, such as the Nasdaq Sustainable Bond Network. Additionally, I authored articles on critical green topics, including the EU Taxonomy Regulation for sustainable investments released in 2020. For my contributions, I was honored with a Nasdaq Leadership Award for excellence in research and writing.

My dedication to sustainability was further demonstrated through my involvement with Nasdaqâs Global Green Team, where I served as the Toronto Office representative. This employee network unites individuals passionate about environmental issues and aims to drive positive change both within the workplace and in the broader community. As part of this network, I coordinated global initiatives alongside Tina Le, the Co-Head of the Global Green Team. For example, I led a voter mobilization event with the Environmental Voter Project, educating over 70 U.S. based Nasdaq employees on how to engage non-voting environmentalists in their networks to become active âsuper voters.â During a business trip to New York, I also had the privilege of coordinating and attending an environmental lunch with Seth Goldman, the executive chairman of Beyond Meat, at his restaurant PLNT Burger.",,,"As a first-year law student at Western University, and a graduate of the Ivey Business School with professional experience at Nasdaq, I am eager to further explore my passion for business law. 

In 2023, I completed my Honours Business Administration degree from the Ivey Business School. This program allowed me to engage in the case-based learning method, providing me with a practical, hands-on understanding of business concepts via the real experiences of business leaders. Notably, I gained valuable knowledge through the Ivey feasibility competition, where my team developed a small business idea and reached the semi-finals out of over 200 teams, as well as the Ivey Field Project, which allowed me to collaborate with former Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson to develop a strategic plan for one of his businesses.

Upon graduation, I joined Nasdaq as a Marketing Associate. Starting as an Intern and progressing to a full-time position, I became a lead copywriter, working closely with subject matter experts to create impactful content on the financial markets, alternative data, and API technology. 

As I deepened my understanding of the markets, I refined my ability to explain complex concepts clearly. When Nasdaq.com first publicly displayed quote data, I created educational content for retail investors, explaining how to interpret this data and leverage the full order book for deeper analysis. I also developed advanced content for professional investors and institutions. Drawing on expert interviews and research, I wrote articles on the EU Taxonomy Regulation for sustainable investments, and the Options Price Reporting Authority's (OPRA) expansion of its pricing information channels. I was ultimately awarded a Nasdaq Leadership Award for my contributions in educational, informative content. 

I played a key role in executing Nasdaqâs communication strategy in response to the SECâs filing of the U.S. Consolidated Equity Tape Plan. In collaboration with Nasdaqâs Head of Data Regulation, I developed a dedicated webpage hub and coordinated an email campaign to address key client questions, provide essential resources, and showcase Nasdaqâs thought leadership. The initiative was well-received, with clients expressing appreciation for our proactive approach, and the talking points I contributed were adopted by employees.","During high school and university, I worked as a graphic designer for several student clubs, where I honed my skills in Photoshop and graphic design.

One of the most impactful experiences was traveling through Southeast Asia for four months. There, I encountered diverse cultures, social issues, and communities grappling with systemic inequality and injustice.

Traveling through countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand allowed me to witness firsthand the disparities in access to education, healthcare, and basic human rights. These experiences sparked a deeper understanding of how social justice intersects with global issues. It became clear that the law plays a crucial role in addressing these challenges and advocating for the rights of marginalized individuals. Now, while studying in London, I am able to transfer these lessons to the diverse community here, engaging with local initiatives and contributing to efforts that promote inclusivity and justice for all. As such, I am a volunteer for Project Consent, under Western's chapter of Pro Bono Students Canada. 

The experiences I gained during my travels have strengthened my empathy, communication skills, and cultural awarenessâqualities that are essential for working within the field of social justice and human rights. 

Through my work with the Canadian Jewish Policial Affairs Committee (CJPAC), I have had the opportunity to engage in initiatives that promote multi-partisanship and advocate for inclusivity across diverse communities. This experience has strengthened my understanding of how the legal system can be a powerful tool for driving meaningful change, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of background, have access to justice and equal opportunities.

Additionally, my involvement with Big Brothers Big Sisters has been instrumental in developing my empathy and commitment to supporting vulnerable populations. Working with children from diverse, historically marginalized backgrounds has allowed me to witness firsthand the challenges they face and the impact that mentorship and advocacy can have on their lives. This experience has reinforced my belief in the power of collaboration and the importance of providing support for those who need it most.

As I continue to pursue a legal career, my goal is to use these experiences to advocate for marginalized communities both locally and globally, inspired by the values I cultivated through travel and my work with organizations dedicated to social justice and human rights.
","Private and civil law fascinates me for its ability to shape fair and equitable outcomes for individuals and organizations navigating complex disputes. My interest in this area stems from both professional exposure and academic experiences, which have underscored its vital role in resolving conflicts and restoring relationships outside the criminal law sphere.  

While working at Thomson Rogers Lawyers, a leading civil litigation firm, I gained valuable hands-on experience in marketing and communications. This role allowed me to showcase the firmâs expertise in areas such as medical malpractice, personal injury, and complex civil disputes. One of my key responsibilities was drafting scripts for a promotional video series based on interviews with civil litigation lawyers. These commercials highlighted significant private law topics, such as class action lawsuits and the civil litigation of sexual assault. The latter particularly resonated with me, sparking my passion for pursuing a career as an advocate for sexual assault survivors.  

This passion deepened during my semester volunteering for Project Consent under Pro Bono Students Canada. Presenting legal information on consent to high school students in London reinforced my understanding of the importance of accessible, accurate legal education. It was empowering to witness how informed discussions on consent could resonate with young audiences, equipping them with the knowledge to navigate sensitive and complex issues.  

These experiences have solidified my commitment to private and civil law, particularly at the intersection of advocacy and social justice. I am eager to build on this foundation by contributing to legal work that protects individual rights, supports survivors, and ensures equitable resolutions. My skills in research, communication, and creative problem-solving, combined with my drive to make a tangible impact, position me strongly for this field.  

With a background in Global Development Studies, I approach legal issues with a lens of equity and inclusivity. Overcoming challenges through collaboration have taught me the value of fair and sustainable solutions. I am excited to bring this perspective to my career in private law, advocating for clients and fostering meaningful change.  ","I began law school with a passion for pursuing international law, driven by a desire to address global challenges and promote justice on a broader scale. As a Jewish individual, my experiences have profoundly shaped my understanding of the complexities of identity, history, and justice within the global legal landscape. Jewish communities have long faced persecution, displacement, and marginalization, fueling my commitment to advocating for human rights, cultural preservation, and equity on a global stage.

My degree in Global Development Studies provided a strong foundation for understanding the intersections of international law, systemic inequalities, and the regulation of global conflicts. For instance, one of my most engaging courses, Development Trends and Challenges in Southern Africa, broadened my perspective by highlighting challenges that transcend Canadaâs borders. A particularly compelling issue was the criminalization of homosexuality in many Southern African countries, which sparked my interest in how international legal systems address such disparities and evolve in response to global challenges to protect human rights and promote justice.

My research position at the Comparative, International and Development Education Centre (CIDEC) at the University of Toronto further shaped my understanding of international law. In this role, I conducted research and systematic literature reviews supporting projects focused on the global political economy of education in the Global South. This work allowed me to explore the intersections between law, education, and international development in vulnerable regions during the height of the covid-19 pandemic.

Additionally, working at the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee (CJPAC) as the Marketing and Communications Coordinator provided allowed me to emphasized multi-partisanship and political engagement across Canada. These experiences refined my research and communication skills, as well as my ability to collaborate effectively across diverse cultural contexts, including working with politicians at all levels of government and from all sides of the political aisle. 

Through my experiences, I have developed a deep understanding of how legal systems can address systemic injustices and promote equitable outcomes on a global scale. My goal is to continue contributing to meaningful resolutions through a career in advocacy, policy development, and legal practice.",,"Throughout my journey thus far at Western law, I have developed a deep passion for Labour and Employment law, driven by both personal, professional and academic experiences. Labour and Employment law resonates deeply with my commitment to supporting individuals in achieving fair and just workplace environments.

Having faced challenges in the workplace, including instances of harassment, I deeply understand the importance of protecting workersâ rights. These experiences have fueled my passion for creating safer, more equitable workplaces and advocating for those who may feel powerless in the face of workplace injustices. Despite initial feelings of shame, I reported the harassment to the HR department, enabling them to address the situation. Fortunately, no legal action was required in my case, but I recognize how crucial it can be for others. My firsthand experience has solidified my understanding of the importance of fostering respectful and just work environments.

In my academic journey, I have excelled in labor and employment law courses, honing my ability to navigate complex legal issues. Assignments in LRWA in Contract Law at Western, and Employment Law coursework at Queenâs have provided me with a solid foundation for understanding and advocating in this field. These experiences have strengthened my skills in legal research and analysis in the preparation of short and long memorandums, drafting a factum, and preparing for a moot. From exploring the nuances of collective bargaining to understanding the complexities of workplace discrimination cases, I am deeply invested in how the legal system can protect vulnerable workers and promote fairness. Overall, I am prepared to handle real-world employment disputes with precision and empathy.

My goal is to build a career in private practice, where I can directly support individuals navigating workplace challenges. Through this path, I aim to empower clients and ensure their rights are upheld, regardless of the size of their employer or the nature of their workplace issues. Ultimately, I hope to make a meaningful impact, fostering justice and equity in the workplace for those who need it most.","When my parents divorced when I was two years old, I never thought I would carry their experience into my career. However, as I began my legal education, I increasingly became interested in helping families navigate similar situations. Growing up in a divorced household is not unique, but my perspectiveâshaped by an amicable relationship between my parents focused on our needsâoffers a distinct insight. In exploring family law, I want to gain practical experience supporting families through similar challenges, building on my personal and professional experiences.

Professionally, my time at Thomson Rogers Lawyers introduced me to family law in practice. While on the marketing team, I had the opportunity to collaborate on communications and engage with family lawyers. This helped me to understand the importance of clear communication in the firmsâ promotional materials, and how the firm engaged with potential clients. Notably, I was responsible for drafting scripts for the thought leadership series, where family lawyers answered questions important to the field. Here, I gained valuable exposure to the compassionate approach required in family lawyers, balancing the need for advocacy with emotional intelligence. 

Academically, my background in Global Development Studies has deepened my understanding of how systemic inequities intersect with family dynamics. I am curious about how family law can better reflect diverse family structures and ensure fairness and access to justice for marginalized communities, especially in cases involving domestic violence or cultural considerations.

My experience mentoring children with Big Brothers Big Sisters Kingston, as well as serving as a head staff member at Bayview Glen Day Camp, strengthened my communication, empathy, and problem-solving skills, essential for building trust with clients from diverse familial backgrounds.

Overall, I am driven to support families with compassion and empathy, ensuring their voices are heard and their interests protected, while recognizing the diverse and complex realities they face.

My undergraduate degree in Global Development Studies exposed me to related but distinct bodies of research, some of which were public health, environmental justice, gender and racial inequality, and Indigenous-state relationships. Common across all of these topics was a theme of access (or a lack thereof) to equality and rights. My studies and subsequent experiences inspired my commitment to advocate for local rights and have equipped me with the skills needed to think critically and work through challenging problems. 

During my undergraduate degree, I also had the opportunity to work for BGC London (formerly the Boys and Girls Club). I transitioned from educational support programs in London to a new and largely experimental role in rural outreach. Through these roles working with vulnerable groups, I have learned that effective communication requires understanding the receiverâs lens to provide information in an appropriate and useful manner. Therefore, these service-based experiences have helped me to develop strong communication and interpersonal skills where I can adapt to unique and unfamiliar circumstances. 

My studies took me beyond local outreach and advocacy to study Indigenous self-determination in Patagonia, Argentina (2023). This deepened my desire to advocate for rights of communities while navigating the complex terrain of history, stakeholder interests, and, at times contradictory, national or regional policies. Most notable was my attendance at a Mapuche celebration of land reclamation after a road construction project commenced without community permission. The community explained how our attendance at this event was symbolic of international support for their assertion of rights and claims to their land. As a result, I learned about the impact that representation and advocacy can make, and I believe that this on the ground experience has given me insight into the complex nature of disputes of this kind. I believe my familiarity working with vulnerable or marginalized communities will prove an asset to working in social justice and human rights law.",,"My motivation to work in international law is largely a product of my educational experiences. My undergraduate degree in Global Development Studies exposed me to the complex terrain of international relations, some of which include migrant studies, Indigenous rights, poverty, and environmental justice. 

One such experience was the opportunity to travel to Patagonia, Argentina (2023) to study Indigenous self-determination. This experiential opportunity deepened my desire to advocate for the rights of communities while navigating the complex terrain of history, diverse stakeholder interests, and, at times contradictory, national or regional policies. One of the most impactful experiences on this trip was our attendance at a Mapuche celebration of land reclamation after a road construction project commenced without community permission. While it was intended to be a celebration, the tense political climate was undeniable as a counter protest assembled in response. Although we approached our position as grateful guests and students, the community explained how our attendance at this event was symbolic of international support for their assertion of rights and claims to their land. From this experience, I have learned about the impact that representation and advocacy can make, and I believe my on the ground experience has given me insight into the competing interests involved in international disputes. 

To expand upon my community-service experience, I have had the opportunity to work for Dr. Katherine Lawless to further develop the field of critical soil science: assisting with many aspects of the project, most notably our scholarly paper âSoil Health is Human Health: Implications for Restoration and Rewildingâ (co-presented at the RE3 2023 Conference in Quebec). This project inspired me to found the Centre for Global Studies Club at Huron, where I assembled a team of leaders to bring the community together through peer support and educational interventions. These experiences have collectively helped me to develop strong analytical and organizational skills in bridging research to event planning and facilitation. My motivation to work in international law, paired with my intercultural engagements, make me a strong candidate for a legal position in international law for summer 2025.","My motivation to work in environmental law is largely a product of my educational experiences. While my undergraduate degree in Global Development Studies exposed me to such topics as migrant studies, Indigenous rights, and poverty, I have been most closely engaged in environmental and food justice. I have had the opportunity to work for Dr. Katherine Lawless to further develop the field of critical soil science: assisting with many aspects of the project, most notably our scholarly paper âSoil Health is Human Health: Implications for Restoration and Rewildingâ (co-presented at the RE3 2023 Conference in Quebec). This project inspired me to found the Centre for Global Studies Club at Huron, where I assembled a team of leaders with diverse backgrounds to bring the community together through peer support and educational interventions. Our March 2023 experiential retreat at Sunnivue Farm (Soil Project research site) created a bridge between research and student life, taking students to see a primary research site. This was specifically meant to show students the connection between sustainability and farming practices. The Club, Sunnivue retreat and team-building opened my eyes to change-making through initiative, leadership and creativity. I have learned how a person who possesses these skills can make an impact, which is what I hope to continue to explore in my career pursuits. 

Relatedly, I had the opportunity to develop educational programming for Life*Spin, an organization that supports low-income families in London. In advancing a goal of food security, the program promoted access to a healthy and sustainable diet by growing vegetables and fruits at home. I have been motivated to seek out similar experiences since, and I began working for BGC London (formerly the Boys and Girls Club). I transitioned from educational support programs in London to a new and largely experimental role in rural outreach. These service-based experiences have helped me to develop strong communication and interpersonal skills where I can adapt to unique and unfamiliar circumstances. I believe my familiarity working with communities on environmental and public health issues will prove an asset to working in environmental law.","My interest to work in labour and employment law has been largely related to my experience working with low-income and equity deserving communities. During my undergraduate degree, I had the opportunity to develop educational programming for Life*Spin, an organization that supports low-income families in London by developing community-based solutions to poverty. In advancing a goal of food security, the program promoted access to a healthy and sustainable diet by growing vegetables and fruits at home. 

Since this experience, I have been motivated to seek out similar roles in order to serve low-income families in my community. I began working for BGC London (formerly the Boys and Girls Club), and transitioned from educational support programs in London to a new and largely experimental role in rural outreach. These service-based experiences have helped me to develop strong communication and interpersonal skills where I can adapt to unique and unfamiliar circumstances. I believe my familiarity working with vulnerable communities with a diverse set of needs and communication styles will prove an asset to working in labour and employment law.

Further, my role as a board member for ROSE Landcare Association (a land-trust organization that promotes biodynamic and sustainable farming practices) has given me insight into the intersectionality of issues within labour and employment law. For example, our current tenant transition has been impacted by a number of shifting variables, including the environmental conditions on farm, previous tenant interests, rental prices and future visions for the development of a âcommunity economyâ on farm. We are in the process of managing current and new tenant interests, while maintaining ROSEâs vision and objectives. This experience has provided me with an understanding of the many interests involved in labour disputes, and the importance in understanding the perspectives of all stakeholders involved. ","My interest in working in family law is largely related to my experience at BGC London (formerly the Boys and Girls Club). As an education resource assistant, I developed close connections with youth and their families. While BGC specifically supports low-income families, I worked with youth from diverse family dynamics. I found myself balancing the program objectives alongside the youthâs and parentâs expectations. I often discussed youthâs behaviour and progress with parents, and had to develop plans that were in line with BGC programming, but also balanced the ideas that each parent had on what educational assistance should look like for their child. As a result, I developed strong communication, interpersonal, and conflict resolution skills in adapting to the unique circumstances of different family dynamics. 

Through these roles, I have learned that effective communication requires understanding the receiverâs lens to provide information in an appropriate and useful manner. This translates to family law in that I have experience understanding and resolving opposing views while providing support to the client I am working for. I believe this experience has also given me insight into considering the views of the many stakeholders involved in a family separation. This will provide me with the skillset to advise a client while bearing in mind the client's burden of making difficult decisions that have implications on their family.",,,164246.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2QsKPlDNDnaaOgt,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_24is7EPXZqjV2hl,"London, ON or remote.","In-Person,Remote,Hybrid",,,,,,,,,

This area of law aligns closely with my values of empathy, equity, and advocacy. I envision my legal career allowing me to participate in and drive policy development that addresses pressing issues in society.
Further, as a Jewish woman I have both experienced and witnessed antisemitism, which is on the rise once again. Having gone to Jewish summer camps growing up, I feel very connected to my Judaism, and hope to use my legal education to help protect our Jewish communities and address the concerning rise in antisemitism.
My business background has equipped me with transferable skills such as strategic thinking, effective communication, and managing complex projects. Additionally, my experience as Co-President of The Link, where I organized events to foster connection, demonstrate my ability to mobilize resources and bring people together for a shared cause.",,,,"My interest in labour and employment law comes from a desire to address the dynamics between employers and employees and to advocate for fair treatment in the workplace. As an oralist in the BLG/Cavalluzzo Labour Law Moot, I had the opportunity to research issues surrounding the constitutionality of a cap on wage increases for public sector employees. This experience taught me the importance protecting the constitutional rights of employees while managing economic challenges.
This field aligns with my values of advocacy, equity, and supporting both individuals and organizations in achieving their goals. Labour and employment law provides a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of human rights and business, two areas I am deeply passionate about. I envision a legal career where I can assist and advocate for clients who are navigating complex workplace issues.
Having completed three co-op work terms and an internship in the summer before starting law school, I have extensive experience interacting with employers and as such I understand firsthand the importance of employee rights. I hope to use my legal education to help employees understand and advocate for their rights. Further, I hope to help employers protect their employees' rights as well as their own company to avoid costly disputes.",,"My focus work experience and focus on entrepreneurship during my business degree has allowed me to gain firsthand insight into the unique challenges faced by small businesses and has provided me with a deep understanding of how businesses are built and scaled from the ground up. 
in my role as an Operations Intern at Jiffy, a home maintenance app where users post job requests and professionals can accept them, I contributed to key business initiatives that helped drive growth and streamline operations. I was given the responsibility of recording and analyzing data on job acceptances to deliver recommendations to key stakeholders regarding the user experience of the Jiffy app as well as potential new policies to increase professionalsâ loyalty towards Jiffyâs clients. Prior to this role, I had the chance to work at Sun Life on numerous internal projects, including being tasked with increasing the productivity of Sun Lifeâs new Hybrid Collaboration Rooms. I gathered employee feedback and subsequently convert it into structured data that allowed my team and I to create evidence-based recommendations for senior executives. As an Account Services Intern on the Petco Account at JAM Direct, I had the opportunity to lead and manage various HTML development projects and to work cross-functionally with the digital and creative teams. I analyzed and compared the results of two major email campaigns by breaking down the difference in open rates, click rates, and other important criteria. Using this analysis, I created a presentation for key Petco stakeholders outlining the data summary and associated recommendations. These roles helped me develop my analytical and communication skills, which are essential for conveying legal concepts in an accessible manner, tailoring solutions to clients with various legal needs, and fostering effective collaboration. 
I am eager to apply my academic background, practical experience, and passion for learning, to assist small businesses in navigating complex legal challenges.","My interest in intellectual property (IP) law stems from a combination of personal curiosity, academic exposure, and a passion for innovation and technology. While working as a Sales and Marketing Representative at Vehikl, a software development company, I gained firsthand insight into the value of protecting intellectual assets in the technology industry. I had the opportunity to work with developers, where I learned of the challenges of safeguarding original ideas in a fast paced, competitive environment.
Moreover, my business background has taught me the importance of intellectual property in driving economic growth and sustaining a competitive advantage. The first few weeks of my BBA program marked the beginning of the BDO New Venture Competition, a motivational experience for those of us with an entrepreneurial mindset. All first-year BBA students were divided into teams and spent eight months creating a business plan for a new product or service. My team and I created Serene â an environmentally sustainable skincare company using water soluble pouches to create zero-waste products. For our interim presentation, we acquired FDA-approved water soluble pouches to provide a demonstration of how our product would work. Upon further fine tuning of our company, including the addition of sustainable manufacturing processes, we drew up the final report that led us to a third-place finish out of over 240 teams.

I am particularly drawn to human rights law for its ability to protect vulnerable populations and advocate for their rights. I am inspired by organizations working on the front lines of these issues, and I am eager to contribute to that important work. My leadership and communication skills are central to my ability to advocate for justice.

I am committed to leveraging my legal education to build a more just and equitable society, particularly for those who have been historically excluded or oppressed. Whether through direct legal advocacy or serving as a role model within my community, I aim to be a voice for those who have been overlooked. As a racial minority and woman in the legal profession, I want to show others that law is accessible to everyone and that the profession has the capacity to advocate for all individuals, regardless of background. It is through this lens of advocacy and justice that I hope to make a lasting impact in the field.","I am motivated to work in private and civil law because it directly impacts individuals' rights and freedoms.

I am confident that these skills and experiences will allow me to contribute meaningfully to a private or civil law practice.","International law has always fascinated me because of its potential to address global challenges and ensure justice across borders. My academic background in business has provided exposure to global markets and international trade, but I am especially interested in the legal dimensions of international relations â particularly in human rights and corporate accountability. I am drawn to the opportunity to use international law to hold corporations accountable for their actions, especially in developing countries where legal protections may be weaker.
I am particularly passionate about the intersection of international law and social justice. International law has the power to promote human rights and encourage ethical business practices across borders. As global trade and corporate activity continue to grow, they present complex challenges, especially in areas such as environmental protection and labor rights. Having traveled to several developing countries across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, Iâve seen firsthand the differences in human rights and environmental laws compared to those in Canada. These experiences have deepened my understanding of the need for global cooperation in addressing these issues, and I hope to bring that perspective to my legal work.
As a child of immigrants, I have heard stories about the varying legal systems and challenges faced by people from around the world, particularly in Asia. This personal connection further fuels my interest in international law, as I am eager to protect vulnerable populations from exploitation and ensure that those in need of legal protections receive them.

This experience sharpened my ability to think critically, distill complex legal principles, and deliver persuasive arguments under pressure. Additionally, my involvement with Pro Bono Students Canada has allowed me to contribute to a resource for the Parkinson Society of Southwestern Ontario, which has highlighted the significant role legal advocacy plays in healthcare.

These experiences have solidified my passion for intellectual property law, and I am eager to combine my interests in healthcare, technology, and intellectual property to help clients navigate complex legal landscapes and foster innovation.

My educational background studying biochemistry and exposure to various areas in the life science has sparked an interest in the interplay between health care and law. I think this gives me a unique perspective on approaching complex legal issues and how I approach problem solving. At this stage in my legal career, I am open minded to experiencing different practice areas and am eager to see how the law is applied to areas that am familiar with. 
I have also developed an interest in the justice system and justice reform after being exposed to the harsh realities of wrongful convictions in Canada and such organizations as Innocence Canada in my criminal law class. I believe practical experience in this area would be invaluable in developing my skills and abilities as a young lawyer but also as a person, when faced with heavy, challenging issues.
These areas of public interest have widespread implications for the community, and I believe I am well equipped to handle them, from my previous academic and extracurricular experience. I have always embraced opportunities to be involved in my community, from participating in student societies to represent the interests of my peers at school, to volunteering my time at community-based organizations such as the Montreal Open Door Shelter, or Halton Food4Kids to supplement meal needs of children in the local school boards.

All countries and cultures have some form of rule of law by which they abide. I would love the opportunity to learn how these laws and legal systems interact, such as what happens when international laws are in conflict. I have already had some early, small exposure to these types of questions in my contracts law class, discussing where and when a contract is formed in an international agreement. 
We are in an era of immense global collaboration, and this has implications for diverse areas of the law. This global perspective allows me to learn more about issues that transcend national borders and gives me the opportunity to work with people of diverse backgrounds and interests. I have always loved to travel and become immersed in new cultures, and I think it would be fascinating to combine the concepts I have learned in law school thus far and this passion, in a hands-on, real-world application. 
My background studying biochemistry and working in research labs gave me a particular interest in intellectual property law, which is just one example of an area of law with profound international implications. Many countries have considerable innovation efforts and are interested in protecting or controlling their progress, while also having an interest in benefiting from our collective knowledge.
Experience in international law would give me a global perspective on important legal issues and expose me to talented legal professionals from Canada and around the world, and hopefully provide me with skills to be an excellent lawyer and to contribute to the betterment of our global community. Having that international awareness in my legal practice will help me to be a better lawyer, advocate, and global citizen.
",,"As a student, my work experience is admittedly limited to part time jobs. Regardless, there have certainly been times where I wondered if I or someone I worked with was being taken advantage of, and how I might determine that. Now in pursuit of a world-class legal education, I would like to gather a better understanding of the rights of employees and associated responsibilities of employers, recognizing that employers too have rights. I want to gain a better understanding of the dynamic of the employee-employer relationship.
In the year after I finished my undergraduate degree I had the opportunity to work as an assistant manager at a Stacked breakfast restaurant. This was my first employment experience in an official leadership role and there were frequently times when I found myself pondering legal questions. I would wonder what risks the company was exposed to when I was terminating a workerâs employment, based on the language used. I would wonder about the rules surrounding operation of the franchise when we would be audited monthly, and what the consequences would be for any shortcomings. I would wonder about the rules for overtime compensation for salaried workers. This position made me aware of the duty I owed to the employees I was responsible for, to be compassionate and fair, as well as the higher management I answered to, to be prudent and precise.  
Learning more about labour and employment law through hands on experience will not only satisfy my own personal curiosity developed through previous work experiences but will give me the knowledge and skills to be able to advocate for workers who do not understand their rights. I am eager for the opportunity to work with experienced and talented legal professionals in this area, especially in the local London community.
",,"As a first-year law student I recognize the importance of exposing myself to a variety of practice areas, especially early in my legal career. I have an idea of areas of law I might be interested in but have so little experience with them. For this reason, I find business law particularly intriguing since it is so interdisciplinary and offers a broad array of career paths. My background in biochemistry and interest in research and innovation has sparked an interest in intellectual property law, which is complemented by so many areas of business law that are crucial to the starting and maintenance of a business.
My undergraduate thesis studying nucleic acid-based therapeutics for disease treatment required systematic problem-solving and creative thinking, skills I was able to refine while  troubleshooting experiments and developing innovative solutions. I became eager to learn more about the behind-the-scenes aspects of research and development, with a particular focus on patent law and the business strategies that support novel ideas.
I thrive in a collaborative, team-oriented environment and have actively sought out extracurricular and work experiences to strengthen my teamwork skills. As President of the Biochemistry Undergraduate Society at McGill, I cultivated an inclusive, cooperative atmosphere for my peers. Leading discussions, resolving conflicts, and seeking guidance when necessary helped me build strong leadership and collaboration abilities. I served as the Vice President of Finance for McGillâs Chapter of Heart4Heart, an organization that raises money for life-saving operations for children born with congenital heart disease in developing countries. I was responsible for maintaining the budget, managing expenses and performing regular audits, which gave me some exposure to the logistical side of operating an organization. I also had the opportunity to advocate for the affected families at educational events, and for my own peers within the organization. At Western Law, Iâve further developed my oral advocacy skills through participation in moots, sharpening my ability to analyze complex issues and present compelling arguments. 
I believe exposure to an interdisciplinary field such as business law at this stage in my career would be invaluable, in providing me with a breadth of opportunity in a dynamic field that is challenging but stimulating and rewarding.","My passion for science and innovation has been a defining feature of my academic journey and has sparked an interest in intellectual property law. During my undergraduate biochemistry thesis, I researched nucleic acid-based therapeutics for disease treatment. This work required resilience, methodical problem-solving, and creative thinkingâskills I honed while troubleshooting experiments and pursuing innovative solutions. These experiences not only deepened my understanding of the scientific process but also developed my interest in the legal aspects of protecting and advancing innovation. I became eager to learn more about what happened behind the scenes in the research and development process.

My undergraduate education at Ivey Business School, where I was recognized for academic excellence, and my subsequent studies at Western University Faculty of Law have provided a robust foundation for exploring complex, cross-border legal issues.
Professionally, my internship at ImRecruitable involved conducting research on the international college sports recruiting process, which enhanced my appreciation for the diverse regulatory landscapes affecting global sports governance. This experience, coupled with my leadership roles, such as serving on the Impact Investment Committee of the Lawson Foundation, further sharpened my ability to evaluate decisions through a global lens while considering their legal and ethical implications.
I am particularly intrigued by issues of international arbitration, cross-border dispute resolution, and the legal mechanisms that govern transnational business operations. My time as an investment banking summer analyst with Britehorn Partners demonstrated the need for a comprehensive understanding of international financial regulations and agreements, as I prepared valuation models and analyzed market trends involving multi-jurisdictional considerations.
My unique perspective as a former national-level tennis player also contributes to my interest in international law. Representing teams in competitions has exposed me to the complexities of international sports law and the need for equitable policies to ensure fairness and inclusion.
Looking forward, I aspire to leverage my legal training and international experiences to address global legal challenges, whether through advocacy, policy development, or practice in a multinational legal environment. My diverse skill setâspanning analytical reasoning, leadership, and cultural adaptabilityâpositions me to contribute meaningfully to the field of international law.
",,,,"My passion for business law stems from my academic background, professional experiences, and leadership roles that emphasize the vital connection between law and business strategy. Having completed my Honours Business Administration (HBA) degree at the Ivey Business School, I developed a deep understanding of how legal frameworks shape business decisions, particularly through courses such as Business Law. These studies provided insight into contractual principles, regulatory compliance, and corporate governance, which I have continued to build upon during my first year at Western Universityâs Faculty of Law.
Professionally, my roles as an Investment Banking Summer Analyst at Britehorn Partners and a Summer Associate at RBC Wealth Management offered firsthand exposure to the practical application of business law. At Britehorn, I assisted in structuring deals for companies where issues like shareholder agreements and intellectual property rights were critical. Similarly, at RBC, I collaborated on managing $220M in assets, navigating financial regulations to deliver tailored investment strategies. These experiences reinforced the importance of legal expertise in facilitating sound business decisions and mitigating risk.
As Head of the Financial Institutions Group at Richmond Capital Partners, I oversee a student-run portfolio and lead analyses of market trends and financial regulations, honing my ability to interpret complex data and make strategic recommendations. Leadership roles, such as serving as Varsity Tennis Captain and on the Lawson Foundationâs Impact Investing Committee, have further equipped me with the collaborative and decision-making skills essential for working with clients and resolving legal challenges.
Business law aligns seamlessly with my career aspirations of empowering organizations by addressing their legal needs. An externship in business law would provide essential skills and knowledge to pursue a future career in corporate and business law, particularly in areas such as corporate governance and contract negotiation.
Through this externship, I aim to refine my legal expertise and gain hands-on experience in advising clients on business law matters. My unique combination of business acumen, legal training, and commitment to community impact positions me to contribute effectively to the dynamic challenges of business law.","My interest in intellectual property law stems from a deep appreciation for innovation and the role of law in fostering creativity and protecting intangible assets. This passion began during my final year at the Ivey Business School, where I participated in the New Venture Project (NVP), an entrepreneurial course that culminated in my team winning the Stephen Suske Award. As the team member responsible for legal strategy, I worked directly with an upper-year law student at Western to address various IP issues, including trademarks, copyrights, and patents. This experience provided practical insights into how IP rights create a competitive advantage, sparking my fascination with IP lawâs role in promoting innovation while safeguarding business interests.
This interest was further reinforced during my summer internship with Britehorn Partners, where I worked with technology companies whose valuations heavily relied on their intellectual property. I observed how intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, and brand equity significantly influence business valuation and transaction outcomes. This exposure deepened my understanding of the strategic importance of IP in the business world and inspired me to pursue a career at the intersection of law, technology, and entrepreneurship.
My academic background has provided a strong foundation for a career in intellectual property law. Courses in Business Law introduced me to key concepts in IP, motivating me to explore real-world issues, such as Nike's patent infringement lawsuits. Analyzing these cases equipped me with a solid understanding of IP principles and their practical applications in complex scenarios.
I am particularly drawn to intellectual property law because of its alignment with my career aspirations of supporting innovators and entrepreneurs. By protecting their creative endeavors, I aim to contribute to a legal framework that fosters technological progress and economic growth. My unique combination of legal training, entrepreneurial experience, and business acumen positions me to approach IP challenges with a comprehensive and innovative perspective.
Through this externship, I hope to refine my skills in IP law while supporting the legal needs of clients who rely on intellectual property as a cornerstone of their ventures.

My undergraduate thesis, which explored attitudes toward immigrants, involved conducting a thorough literature review, analyzing data, and presenting complex results in a clear and coherent manner, all of which enhanced my ability to communicate effectively.
In addition to my thesis, I have also gained experience working as a research assistant at Kingâs University College. Through this role, I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills. I conducted literature reviews, analyzed data, and assisted in the development of research proposals. These experiences have given me a deep understanding of the importance of attention to detail and organization.

Meeting with and managing the files of up to 15 clients at a time and drafting preliminary narratives taught me not only perseverance but also the critical role
that public interest law has in peopleâs lives and the community at large. Too often, those most in need of legal resources face barriers to accessing justice. Thus, organizations and practitioners that provide aï¬ordable legal services in public interest matters are essential to building and
maintaining a fair and equitable society. 

I have always been driven by a desire to help others and serve my community. Inspired by my parentsâa doctor and a teacherâwho dedicated their
careers to helping others, I actively sought opportunities to make a meaningful impact. At Wilfrid Laurier University, I studied Political Science with the goal of pursuing advocacy and local politics. Although I decided against a career in politics, my passion for advocacy and community involvement remains unchanged. Public interest law allows me to channel that passion into
meaningful work that directly impacts peopleâs lives, and I am eager to use my legal education to make a diï¬erence in my community.

learning about legal and regulatory frameworks.","With my legal education, practical experience in legal research and writing, as well as my strong interest in innovation and creativity, I am eager to explore the practice area of Intellectual Property. At Lynx Equity Limited, I assisted legal counsel by reviewing and analyzing legal documents, including those related to acquisitions and contracts. This experience sharpened my
ability to dissect complex agreements and identify key provisions, skills essential for addressing the intricacies of intellectual property matters. One particular concern I helped address was making sure trade secrets and other matters sensitive to the success of the business being acquired was kept confidential by any outgoing owner after the M&A process. I gained first-hand
experience in drafting non-compete clauses and non-disclosure agreements in order to address this concern.

As a Student Policy Analyst with the Region of Waterloo Community Housing Services, I conducted in-depth legal research and policy reviews, simplifying complex regulations into actionable insights. This experience revealed to me the critical role civil law plays in addressing housing disputes and protecting vulnerable populations, sparking my interest in the broader applications of private law.

During my time as a Co-op Student at Oak & Stone Developments, I witnessed firsthand the intersection of civil law and regulatory compliance. By researching local zoning laws, building codes, and land-use regulations, I contributed to ensuring legal compliance in property development. Collaborating with legal teams further solidified my understanding of the legal frameworks underpinning private sector operations, inspiring me to explore this area further.

My curiosity lies in understanding how civil law can bridge gaps between individuals and institutions, particularly in areas like real estate, contracts, and housing disputes. Questions such as how the law can equitably balance the rights of parties in private disputes or adapt to emerging societal challenges motivate me to deepen my expertise in this field.

These experiences align with my aspirations to advocate for equitable solutions in the private law realm. My work with Pro Bono Students Canada on employment rights outreach honed my ability to simplify complex legal concepts for diverse audiences, a skill I plan to apply to civil law practice. Volunteer roles with organizations such as Gursikh Saba Canada and Ray of Hope instilled a profound sense of empathy and cultural sensitivity, which shape how I approach legal challenges and client advocacy.

Ultimately, my unique perspective, shaped by my academic background, professional experiences, and a commitment to justice, positions me to excel in civil and private law. I am driven by the belief that law is a powerful tool for resolving conflicts and fostering fairness, which aligns seamlessly with my career goals in advocacy and policy within private practice.
","My interest in international law has been cultivated through a combination of academic study, professional experience, and exposure to global perspectives. During my undergraduate studies in Legal Studies at the University of Waterloo, I enrolled in courses which introduced me to the legal mechanisms that govern international relations and the enforcement of rights across borders, fostering a keen interest in understanding how international law operates within complex political and economic systems.

Professionally, my role as a Student Policy Analyst at the Region of Waterloo Community Housing Services provided practical insight into how legal frameworks impact housing policies at a local level. This experience piqued my curiosity about how international human rights standards influence domestic legislation, particularly in addressing issues like housing insecurity and equitable access to resources. 
Similarly, during my tenure at Oak & Stone Developments, I collaborated with legal teams to ensure compliance with zoning and building regulations. This work underscored the interconnectedness of regulatory systems and highlighted the importance of understanding legal principles that transcend national boundaries.

In addition to academic and professional exposure, my volunteer work has informed my perspective on international law. Working with Gursikh Saba Canada, I engaged with diverse communities facing challenges such as immigration, housing instability, and discrimination. These experiences provided a firsthand understanding of the broader implications of migration policies and global justice systems, reinforcing my commitment to exploring international legal issues that directly affect individuals and communities.

My academic and professional experiences have equipped me with transferable skills relevant to international law, including legal research, policy analysis, and cross-cultural communication. I am particularly interested in exploring questions such as how international treaties can effectively address global challenges like climate change, and how international trade law adapts to technological advancements in the global economy.

Looking ahead, I aim to integrate these experiences into a career in international law, focusing on advocacy and policy work that bridges domestic and international systems. My background provides me with a unique perspective to address global legal challenges with both rigor and empathy, ensuring impactful and equitable solutions.
",,"My interest in labour and employment law grew from a combination of focused academic exploration and hands-on experience addressing workplace legal issues. In my Legal Research, Writing, and Advocacy (LRWA) course, I extensively researched and analyzed the topic of wrongful dismissal, crafting detailed written assignments and honing my ability to navigate employment law's complexities. This academic work deepened my understanding of the rights and obligations governing employment relationships and revealed the critical role this area of law plays in ensuring workplace equity and justice.


Professionally, my involvement with Pro Bono Students Canadaâs Nokee Kwe Employment Rights Outreach Project has been transformative. I conducted in-depth legal research on employment law processes, workplace conflict resolution, and wrongful dismissal while creating accessible resources for equity-denied groups and small businesses. This role also involved collaborating with supervising lawyers to develop and deliver presentations on topics such as workplace discrimination and harassment. Through this work, I gained a deeper appreciation for how employment law directly impacts individualsâ lives, from safeguarding rights to empowering employers to foster fair workplace environments.

My experiences volunteering with organizations such as House of Friendship and Ray of Hope further underscore the importance of labour and employment law in addressing systemic workplace challenges. I have seen the profound impact of unemployment, discrimination, and precarious work on individuals and their families, motivating me to contribute to a legal system that ensures fairness and accountability in employment practices.

I am particularly drawn to questions around how employment law adapts to emerging issues like the gig economy, workplace equity, and the protections afforded to non-standard workers. These areas present exciting opportunities to engage with evolving legal frameworks and advocate for balanced solutions.

With a strong foundation in legal research, practical experience addressing employment law issues, and a commitment to advancing workplace fairness, I aim to contribute meaningfully to this field. My goal is to work at the intersection of advocacy and policy, helping shape equitable workplace standards that reflect the needs of a changing workforce.
",,"My interest in business law is rooted in a combination of academic exploration, hands-on experience, and a deep curiosity about how legal frameworks support corporate innovation and accountability. During my undergraduate studies in Legal Studies and Business at the University of Waterloo, I gained a robust understanding of corporate governance, financial structures, and the legal principles that underpin business operations. Many of my courses exposed me to the complexities of managing cross-border transactions, navigating regulatory frameworks, and balancing stakeholder interests. These studies sparked a lasting curiosity about how businesses operate within and across legal systems.

A highlight of my academic experience was participating in capstone projects that simulated real-world business scenarios. In the CapSim project, I managed a virtual corporation, overseeing strategic decisions such as pricing, resource allocation, and market entry. The project required meticulous analysis of financial reports and strategic forecasting, skills directly transferable to business law practice. In another project, I developed a marketing strategy for a small local startup, navigating branding, consumer engagement, and financial planning. These experiences not only sharpened my understanding of business operations but also highlighted the pivotal role that contracts, compliance, and intellectual property protections play in business success.

Professionally, my role at Oak & Stone Developments deepened my understanding of how legal compliance drives successful business ventures. I researched zoning laws, building codes, and regulatory frameworks, ensuring projects met legal requirements. Collaborating with legal teams, accountants, and realtors further underscored the importance of well-structured agreements and clear communication in achieving corporate objectives. My role as a Student Policy Analyst at the Region of Waterloo exposed me to how regulatory frameworks shape economic conditions, from influencing housing markets to driving community development initiatives.

I am particularly intrigued by how business law addresses challenges like corporate accountability, compliance in emerging markets, and legal risks associated with technological innovation. These areas align with my career aspirations to support businesses in navigating complex legal landscapes. By combining my academic foundation, practical experiences, and strategic thinking, I aim to contribute to innovative legal solutions that enable businesses to thrive while upholding ethical and regulatory standards.
","My interest in intellectual property (IP) law stems from personal experiences, academic studies, and professional exposure. Having contributed to small business development within my family and friend circle, I witnessed firsthand the challenges of turning ideas into marketable assets. This experience emphasized the importance of IP law in protecting not only creative works but also the significant investments behind new products and services.

During my undergraduate studies in Legal Studies, I took courses exploring the intersection of law, technology, and innovation, which sparked my curiosity about how IP frameworks address technological advancements and globalization. Additionally, the growing significance of IP law in the medical fieldâranging from pharmaceutical patents to biotechnologyâcaptured my attention. Questions such as how IP laws can incentivize medical research while balancing accessibility to life-saving treatments drive my interest in this critical area.

Professionally, my role as a Student Policy Analyst at the Region of Waterloo Community Housing Services sharpened my ability to conduct detailed research and simplify intricate legal concepts. Similarly, at Oak & Stone Developments, I collaborated with legal teams to navigate regulatory complexities, demonstrating my capacity for precision and critical thinking in legally dense environments. These roles equipped me with transferable skills in legal research, policy development, and effective communicationâkey competencies for addressing IP challenges, particularly in medical and technological contexts.

Currently, as a volunteer with Pro Bono Students Canada, I develop accessible legal resources and conduct research to support underserved communities. This role has strengthened my ability to balance complex legal considerations with client-focused solutions, a principle at the heart of IP law in both entrepreneurial and medical contexts.

Looking forward, I want to learn more about the intersection of intellectual property, innovation, and policy. Whether working on protecting groundbreaking medical technologies, addressing patent disputes, or supporting entrepreneurs in their creative ventures, I seek to engage with the multifaceted challenges of IP law. My goal is to contribute to a legal framework that fosters innovation while ensuring equitable access to its benefitsâparticularly in critical areas like healthcare and biotechnology.

I have come to appreciate how systemic injustices and individual hardships are shaped by complex socioeconomic and identity-based factors, which must be addressed in order to support marginalized groups effectively. I have also been shown the indispensability of nonprofits and NGOs in filling gaps in government action and mobilizing and supporting the public on critical welfare issues. 
Throughout my education, I have worked on several long-term research projects that explored these challenges. In both curricular and extracurricular settings, I have studied and advocated for judicial and legal reforms that acknowledge the disproportionate impact of harmful rhetoric and misinformation, inequitable labour practices, and poor democratic representation on marginalized groups. I also conducted a research project examining anti-homeless infrastructure and the potential for more just alternatives. In law school, I have had the opportunity to contribute to Pro Bono Students Canadaâs mission by researching rights and resources available to patients with Parkinsonâs disease and creating materials outlining these tools for impacted individuals and families. Additionally, my experience working at Kitchener Housing provided me with firsthand insight into the housing and poverty challenges faced by those who rely on low-income residents. Over the summer, I witnessed poor security, cleanliness, and operational conditions within government-funded housing. Many of these residents also experienced physical and mental disabilities throughout their tenancy, which exacerbated the effects of these hardships. 
These experiences have given me a thorough and heartbreaking awareness of the many barriers that vulnerable groups face and I am eager to take on a more direct role in creating social and institutional change. Public interest calls to me because of its unique overlap of law and policy; the two subjects to which I have dedicated the last decade of my life to studying. I would be honoured to contribute to efforts aimed at influencing public policy and law and supporting those affected by oppression and tragedy. I am very excited about the opportunity to take steps towards my career goals in this field. ","My undergraduate studies in Political Science have equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of the complex intersectionality of social justice and human rights issues. I have studied how systemic injustices and individual hardships are shaped by socioeconomic and identity-based factors, which must be addressed in order to support marginalized people effectively. Additionally, I recognize the important relationship between government agencies and NGOs in driving reform and supporting individuals who are vulnerable to exploitations of the justice system. 
Throughout my academic journey, I have been committed to advocacy and research on these critical issues. I have participated in several legal advocacy competitions and research projects, where I analyzed gaps in the justice systemâs engagement with marginalized groups. One project discussed psychological detention and the heightened risk of self-incrimination among individuals with generational trauma involving police. Another focused on the accessibility of justice and the disproportionate barriers that certain groups face when trying to navigate the justice system (ex: uninformed pleas). Subsequent advocacy projects allowed me to further my understanding of how factors such as unreasonable delay, flawed jury charges or unlawful search and seizure may allow for an Accused to be acquitted. These opportunities ignited my passion for engaging both law and policy to find solutions. 
My position with the Ministry of the Attorney General provided firsthand insight into the dangers of inaccessibility. Many individuals failed to schedule or missed pre-trial meetings, causing months of delay while awaiting a new court date. I also noticed that self-representing individuals waited far longer to communicate with Crowns, as priority was given to those with formal representation. Further, many of the charges could have been avoided altogether with proper public education about the law and peopleâs rights. 
 These issues have become increasingly evident as I continue to study and work in this field. Had I gone to graduate school, I had planned to research and write my thesis on the challenges faced by marginalized groups when engaging with the legal system. Thus, I am eager for an opportunity to support efforts in this area and learn more about how to rectify these injustices. ","Throughout the last five years, I have held several roles that have shed light on the injustices faced by marginalized groups in Canada. I have studied systemic inequality in many contexts during my undergraduate degree, and am especially invested in promoting gender, racial, and socioeconomic equality. Of course, the challenges faced by these groups often intersect or are a product of broader discriminatory ideologies. This is why it is essential to analyze inequitable practices and potential alternatives from both legal and political lenses. This intersection of law and policy has always fascinated me, and for this reason, I am eager to enter a field where I can engage both perspectives to help vulnerable members of our community. 
	I have also worked for the government in two capacities - in public housing and Crown prosecution. During this time, I witnessed the many obstacles that the poor, disabled, and immigrant communities face at an institutional level. These groups are disproportionately impacted by communication issues, lack of access to legal representation, and a reluctance to validate many invisible disabilities. My frustration with these systems is another reason I am compelled to pursue a career in fighting systemic injustice. 
	My time with Laurier Moot Court also allowed me to conduct in-depth research into the exercise of fundamental freedoms within criminal law. I studied and advocated for democratic rights while mooting on Toronto (City) v Ontario (Attorney General), life, liberty, and security in R v Sharma, and against unreasonable search and seizure in R v Zacharias. While in Moot Court, I was also responsible for creating educational resources for incoming members. I gave seminars on how to analyze legal issues and advocate for reform in a courtroom setting. Further, I have recently joined Pro Bono Students Canada, where my research team has been tasked with creating tools to educate Parkinsonâs disease patients and their caregivers on their healthcare rights. These experiences have shown me how public education is key to dismantling barriers to justice and fighting inequality, and I hope to continue to help others navigate the legal system and understand their rights and freedoms. ",,,"I am deeply fascinated by the unique intersection of law and policy featured in the labour and employment field. The compounding pressures of socioeconomic marginalization, exploitative profiteering, and misinformation on workersâ rights have created a climate of vulnerability for employees at all levels. Consequently, advocacy work in defending and educating workers is crucial to building a resilient workforce, and I am eager to contribute to this mission. Whether in the context of workplace injury, discrimination, or harassment, workers must be empowered to hold their employers accountable. The public education aspect of this pursuit is also interesting to me because it takes proactive steps to safeguard workers before they suffer potentially life-altering interruptions to their employment.
Throughout my academic journey, I have been torn between pursuing law or policy. Thus, the chance to gain experience that blends the two paths would be both stimulating and significantly beneficial to my future. While I have not yet worked directly in this field, past positions have equipped me with a range of transferable skills that, when paired with my passion for people-centred work, make me a strong candidate. Through my involvement with Laurier Moot Society and Pro Bono Students Canada, I gained invaluable research and advocacy skills. These positions also gave me experience in public education, specifically delivering training seminars on legal analysis and creating tools to inform people of their rights. I also worked as an administrator for Kitchener Housing and at the Crownâs Office. This honed my ability to juggle a wide variety of everyday tasks, such as managing phone lines and emails and drafting and reviewing legal documents. Past employers have commended my strong time management skills and ability to problem-solve independently. Therefore, I believe that placing me with one of these organizations would not only allow me to gain on-the-job experience but would relieve some of the pressure on the rest of the staff for the summer so they can focus on their core mission. ","During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of being mentored by an incredible family lawyer. Under his guidance, I gained a deeper understanding of family law, which transformed my initial perception of the field. I had once been influenced by the narrative that family law is centred on breaking families apart, but now see that family law is not just about division, but also protection. While the separation of families can be tragic, the element of creating new starts and healthier lives is a core component that has come to fascinate and inspire me.
Family law has been a prominent part of my life, and Iâve witnessed its impact in many forms. Within my family, I have seen many marriages end without spousal support due to one partnerâs refusal to pay and the otherâs inability to access legal advice. I have also watched as spouses use financial manipulation to coerce their partners to stay with them. The complexity of prenuptial agreements often also results in many former spouses receiving less than they are entitled to due to a lack of proper counsel. While divorce is undoubtedly painful, I believe it is sometimes the best path for both parties, and understanding this dynamic is key to providing effective and empathetic legal support to separating families. 
	Furthermore, I have seen the challenges that arise in cases involving children. I have witnessed situations where children were placed in homes that were not adequately suited to meet their needs, or where custody battles were driven by reasons beyond the best interests of the child. These experiences reinforced my belief in the importance of a well-rounded approach to family law; one that carefully considers all angles of a separation and equitably analyzes each partyâs interests. 
Family law extends far beyond financial concerns, and special care must be taken to minimize trauma and protect the emotional and psychological well-being of family members. I am interested in a family law internship because I am passionate about using my knowledge and skills to help people and to bring a sensitive and empathetic approach to my work.

I have previously worked with and for the clinic, and its focus on social justice and ensuring equitable access to legal resources aligned with my commitment to using law as a tool for positive social impact. 

The mentor I had chosen is a person of great leadership and patience. I personally value him as a role model from my previous experiences of working with him on client employment matters. His expertise in employment law is one of the reasons I wish to explore employment law next year in law school. 

The mission of DCLS is to provide legal assistance and advocacy to individuals who cannot afford traditional legal representation, with a focus on housing law, social assistance, and employment law. This mission is closely tied to my passion for social justice and my desire to contribute to public interest law, particularly in advocating for equitable access to legal remedies. 

Previously working at DCLS, I gained hands-on experience conducting client intake interviews, preparing appeal forms, and assisting clients with navigating complex legal processes. This role offered direct exposure to real-world legal practice, which allowed me to develop client-centered problem-solving skills and a practical understanding of procedural and substantive law beyond academic study. Furthermore, having discussed with the clinic, they would be allow me to take on advocacy roles over the summer (e.g. client representation in a tribunal), which I believe will further my legal research and analytical skills, as well as generally provide me with legal experience that many would not get until they begin practicing. 

Responsibilities would include interviewing clients to gather facts, analyzing relevant legal materials, drafting appeal forms, assisting with research for case preparation, synthesizing legal information into educational materials, and client representation. 

This experience strengthened my interest in public interest law and provided a foundation for developing strong research, advocacy, and legal drafting skills. Furthermore, with litigation being another area of interest, gaining early client advocacy experience would be greatly beneficial in planning out my career path.

By working in an area of public interest law, I will be able to contribute to addressing the access to justice gap that exists in our society. I am passionate about getting involved in advocating for marginalized communities, which is why I believe I would excel in a role in this sector. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I volunteered at pop-up vaccination clinics in locations with high rates of homelessness and addiction, striving to improve access to essential healthcare services during this extremely difficult time. In addition, I also volunteered at the local homeless shelter serving the shelter residents hot meals, with the goal of further contributing to the well-being of the community.
I have also worked closely with two families who have children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). My responsibilities included assisting with meal preparation, taking the children on outings, and engaging in their favourite activities. Throughout this time, I educated myself about ASD and learned about the struggles this community was facing. I attended many demonstrations advocating for securing proper funding and resources for individuals with ASD. At these protests, I spoke about the issues effecting the ASD community and the importance of advocating for these individuals. This experience was profoundly meaningful to me, as it allowed me to develop skills in advocating for those who are often unable to advocate for themselves.
Although I have not gained experience working in the legal sector yet, I am confident that my experience in the workforce, volunteer positions, and advocacy roles will provide a strong foundation for contributing effectively to a position in this sector. My firsthand experiences with advocacy for marginalized communities has fueled my desire to address these issues within the legal domain. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to further refine my skills while applying my existing experience in advocacy to aid individuals seeking support or guidance in various areas of law.","I feel strongly about working in a position that will allow me to be apart of advocating for social justice and human rights. Throughout my first semester at Western Law, I have been working as an associate case worker under the supervision of lawyers and upper-year students to provide legal aid to those in the London area at Community Legal Services, an onsite legal clinic at Western Law. I have been working primarily on criminal law files and assisting with research, document drafting, and attending client meetings. This experience has fueled my desire to continue to work with those who would otherwise face barriers accessing legal guidance as I have witnessed firsthand the importance of ensuring that everyone has access to justice.
During the COVID 19-pandemic, I also volunteered at pop-up vaccination clinics in areas that addiction and homelessness were prevalent, striving to increase access to essential healthcare services during this challenging time. In addition, I also volunteered at a local homeless shelter serving the shelter residents breakfast, with the goal of making a beneficial impact on the wellbeing of my community. Through these volunteering opportunities I was able to continue to help provide access to essential needs of those experiencing homelessness, which is very meaningful to me and aligns with my vision of what kind of legal work I would like to pursue in my career. 
Although I have limited exposure to working in the legal sector, I believe that my experiences through my employment, volunteer positions and in advocating for marginalized communities supplement this and will guide me in effectively contributing to a position that focuses on human rights and eliminating barriers to justice. I am looking for an opportunity to continue to address the access to justice gap that exists in the legal system, and I am eager to continue to help marginalized communities obtain access to essential services.","Although I do not have any pre-existing work experience in private or civil law, my law school education thus far has provided me with insight as to what a job in this field could look like. When learning about contract law and tort law, I have found myself to be very engaged and interested in topics such as dispute resolution, negligence, and tort law, more specifically, providing a remedy to those who have been wronged but cannot find a remedy through the criminal justice system. I am particularly drawn to private and civil law because it direct impacts the lives of the individuals, often by providing them a remedy when their rights have been violated. 
I have also worked closely with families who have children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). During this time, I learned about the struggles this community was facing and attended demonstrations advocating for proper funding and resources for individuals with ASD. At these events, I spoke about the issues effecting the ASD community and the importance of advocating for these individuals. This experience allowed me to develop skills in advocating for those who are often unable to advocate for themselves. Currently, my interest in advocating for the rights of others motivates me to get involved, now in the legal sector, and contribute in a way that I have not had the opportunity to do until this point in my education.
Through both my past employment and legal education thus far, I have learned how to think critically, multitask well, communicate effectively, and resolve conflicts with a solution-based approach. I believe that these abilities will aid me in contributing well to a team in the private law sector as I believe that these skills are essential to working in this domain. I am also drawn to private law due to the variety in the cases that this domain of law encompasses. I am drawn to the fast-paced and dynamic work environment that this area of practice offers, and I am excited to continue to challenge myself and compliment my legal studies with this practical hands-on experience. 
",,,"While I have no work experience in labour and employment law, this field has always interested me, and this interest has grown throughout my first semester of law school. Although I have not be able to take any courses that focus specifically on labour and employment law, I have read cases about discrimination in the workplace and employee rights in my tort law class. These cases piqued by interest and have caused me to think more critically about working in the labour law sector and advocating for both individuals and employers to ensure that there is fair treatment in the workplace and that labour laws are being followed. 
Concerning labour and employment law, legal issues such as wrongful termination, harassment, OHSA disputes, and wage negotiations are of interest to me. I believe that my experiences in my past employment and legal studies have provided me with skills such as legal research, effective communication, and critical thinking that will be transferrable to contributing effectively to a position in labour law. I am eager for the opportunity to challenge myself by gaining hands-on experience in labour law while applying my existing skills to this position to be a valuable member in the workplace. 
",,"I am looking for an opportunity to expand my knowledge of business law and working in the business/commerce sector. Although I have no direct experience in business law, I have many years of experience working in customer service which has provided me with many transferrable skills that would aid me in thriving in this field. Working in the customer service industry has allowed me to refine my communication skills in order to communicate clearly and effectively with others, effectively manage relationships, and approach challenges with a solutions-based way of thinking. I believe that these skills will help me understand client needs and efficiently resolve issues in a timely manner â abilities that I believe are essential to transactions in business law.
Additionally, my experience in customer service has allowed me to understand the importance of professionalism in customer interactions, which I know is extremely important when working with clients in this domain, specifically regarding legal matters. Similar to my past employment experiences, the fast-paced and often demanding nature of business law entices me, and I am eager to work in a field that is challenging while applying my passion for problem-solving in a legal setting.
In November 2024, I competed in the Torys LLP Negotiation competition alongside one of my colleagues. This was my first exposure to what a career in business law could entail and it greatly sparked my interest in this field. The moot focused on negotiating the terms of a merger between two companies, including but not limited to respective financial contributions, company management, IPO, and indemnification. This experience has made me want to learn more about business law and get more hands-on exposure to working in this field as I prepare for my future career.  I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to further refine my skills in this new setting while applying my experiences in other industries to aid my growth in this new venture.",,154245.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2ZUFEqG0sIe63FP,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2XbMfhnXzimOXM1,,,,,,,,,,,

The issues addressed by public interest are broad, which is appealing to me, as I am eager to explore different areas of the law. Prior to law school, I worked in the housing and homelessness sector, which sparked my interest in access to justice, housing, homelessness prevention and more. Many of the clients that I worked with lived in poverty and were either homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. This work provided me with the opportunity to see firsthand many of the issues that people in my community faced on a daily basis. Through this position, I also learned how to communicate and build positive relationships with highly vulnerable populations, as well as developed the skills to advocate on the behalf of the clients that I worked with. 

Public interest stands out to me because many of the focus areas it encompasses address the issues that I was exposed to through my work with vulnerable and at-risk populations. I thoroughly enjoyed being involved in my community through the work I did prior to law school, as I met with clients in the community everyday, often attended public events on behalf of my agency, as well as attended weekly meetings with other agencies to discuss ways to assist various at-risk individuals in the area. This involvement grew my desire to work with and for my community in the future. The areas of law in which public interest encompasses would provide me with the best opportunity to do exactly this. 

I believe that I would excel in a role focusing on an area of public interest due to my experience working closely with members of disadvantaged groups in my community and acting as an advocate to help these individuals work toward achieving their goals. While I do have some prior knowledge of the housing and homelessness sector, I am passionate and excited about expanding my knowledge into different focus areas.","Social justice and human rights law is of interest to me because of my passion for advocacy and my prior exposure to social justice issues through academic studies and past employment experience. During my undergraduate studies, I gained valuable knowledge regarding social justice and human rights issues, primarily regarding issues of race, sex and class. The knowledge I gained through the completion of my undergraduate studies provided me with a foundation through which I hope to base my future legal career upon. I strive to go about my studies and everyday life with an intersectional understanding of the barriers that different groups of people face, as well as recognize and challenge these barriers where possible. 

Prior to law school, I also worked in the housing and homelessness sector, as I worked for a non-profit organization aimed at preventing youth homelessness. In this position, I managed a caseload of clients who were either experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness. Through this position, I saw firsthand the ways in which vulnerable populations experience barriers on a daily basis. This position enhanced my understanding of various social justice and human rights issues, including the gap in access to justice, systemic and institutionalized racism, the housing crisis, issues with social assistance, and so much more. 

This position also sparked my interest in advocacy, which is something that I would like to focus on as I pursue my future legal career. While working in this position, I frequently advocated on the behalf of my clients to various third parties. For example, many of my clients experienced issues with their landlords, such as constant threats of eviction. When this happened, I was able to call the landlord and engage in a professional conversation with them. These conversations typically centred around conflict resolution and problem-solving in an attempt to maintain the clientâs housing. This type of work helped to develop my oral advocacy skills, which is something I believe is vital to social justice and human rights law.","I am deeply interested in various areas of private/civil law due to their significant impact on everyday life and their ability to shape the dynamics between individuals, organizations, and society at large. At its core, civil law addresses fundamental issues of rights, obligations, and responsibilities, which makes it essential for resolving disputes and ensuring fairness.

Contract law is one area of civil law particularly of interest to me. The creation and enforcement of agreements underpin nearly all transactions in society, which demonstrates the large-scale significance of contract law in general. Understanding the principles that govern these interactions have been of momentous interest to me over the course of my first semester of law school. While I am new to the area of contract law, my interest was enhanced further by my participation in a negotiation moot during last semester. Negotiating on behalf of a fictitious client to reach a business agreement not only enhanced my oral advocacy skills, but also furthered my enthusiasm for contract law. 

Tort law is another area that intrigues me, particularly because it focuses on protecting individuals from harm caused by others. This area of law not only addresses personal injuries but also tackles broader societal issues, as well. The broad scope of tort law interests me, as it focuses on righting a wide variety of wrongs. Personal injury interests me most, as it provides a remedy to a victim in a way that criminal law, for example, cannot. I would like to learn more about this area of law.   

Finally, property law, with its focus on ownership, use, and transfer of assets, is an area I find compelling, as well. Real estate transactions, intellectual property rights, and law governing land use all present complex legal questions that I am eager to learn more about.",,,"I am interested in labour and employment law because of my passion for advocacy and ensuring access to justice, particularly for individuals who face systemic barriers to employment. My previous experience working with vulnerable youth, many of whom struggled to maintain stable employment, has greatly shaped my understanding of the challenges people face in the workforce. I have seen firsthand how individuals from marginalized communities encounter significant obstaclesâwhether due to discrimination, lack of skills, or unstable living conditionsâthat hinder their ability to secure and maintain employment. 
Through my work with at-risk youth, I observed the ways in which external factors impact employment outcomes. For many of the individuals I supported, securing a job was just the beginning of a much larger struggle. They faced barriers like unstable housing, mental health challenges, lack of access to education and training, or conflicts with employers due to issues like harassment or unfair treatment. In these instances, the legal protections available to workers were often not enough, or not accessible in a way that was understandable or practical for them.
Labour and employment law offers the tools to create more equitable workplace environments and to ensure that workers, especially those from vulnerable or disadvantaged backgrounds, are treated fairly. By focusing on labour law, I hope to be part of efforts that break down the systemic barriers to employment and ensure that all individuals, regardless of background, have access to meaningful and secure work. My skills and passion for advocacy, which I believe will help many individuals navigate the legal landscape to achieve justice, drive my interest in this field of law. ",,"I am drawn to business law because of the opportunity it presents to engage in dynamic, practical legal work that can have a significant impact on businesses. While my experience in this area is limited, I developed a strong interest in business law during my contract law class, where I found the intricacies of legal agreements and the strategic considerations behind contract negotiations particularly intriguing.
My interest in business law was further sparked during the Torys LLP Negotiation Competition last semester, where I had the chance to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world, competitive setting. The experience of negotiating complex issues, finding creative solutions, and working with my colleagues to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome solidified my enthusiasm for the field. It highlighted the importance of effective communication, strategic thinking, and legal expertise- all of which are critical skills in this area of law.
Although my exposure to business law is still developing, I am eager to explore its diverse areas. The fast-paced and constantly evolving nature of business law excites me, as it provides an opportunity to be at the intersection of legal, financial, and commercial decision-making. I am particularly interested in understanding how corporate lawyers help companies minimize legal risks and foster innovation. 
Ultimately, my interest in business law lies in the challenge of solving complex problems and contributing to the success of organizations in constantly changing business environments. I am excited to further develop my skills in this field and explore how I can use my legal training to support businesses in achieving their goals.",,180324.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2VDxMdjo7Di5kDl,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2CZJwxl2iTizzWk,,,,,,,,,,,

This experience illuminated the intellectually and strategically demanding aspects of civil law, sparking my interest in pursuing a career in civil litigation. The prospect of continually encountering intellectual challenges throughout my career excites me. I appreciate there is much to learn and hope to have that opportunity. I am particularly drawn to civil litigation because of the breadth it offers. The field spans a broad range of issues, including private torts, property disputes, and contract breaches, requiring litigators to engage in constant learning and innovation. Civil litigation is unique in its unpredictability; cases often turn on the discovery of key evidence or asking the right question during a deposition, making each case an investigative process. The dynamic nature of civil law is appealing, and I am eager to explore different facets of civil law to develop the skills necessary to navigate its complexities. Additionally, my experience with client advocacy has equipped me for a role in civil/private law. As an Associate Caseworker at Western Community Legal Services, I conduct client intake interviews, draft legal documents, and prepare clients for court appearances in family and criminal law matters. This requires a careful analysis of each case, sensitivity to client needs, and a high degree of empathy, skills that are transferable to civil litigation. I am confident that my experience will allow me to contribute effectively to this area of the law. ","My interest in international law stems from my exchange experience at the University of Siena in Italy. I took a course about emerging trends in international criminology. A pivotal moment came when I partook in a rehabilitative initiative at a medium-security prison in Volterra. Inmates prepared and served dinner to guests in the courtyard of the prison, and I had the opportunity to casually interact with a few of them. The experience sparked a curiosity in me about how different legal jurisdictions address issues such as rehabilitation, the treatment of offenders, and human rights. I began to question how international law can promote accountability, justice, and social reintegration across different legal systems. These questions have driven my passion for international law, particularly in the areas of human rights enforcement, the interplay between domestic and international legal systems, and the regulation of multinational corporations. My experiences have equipped me with the skills necessary to excel in this field. As an Associate Caseworker at Community Legal Services, I gained hands-on experience conducting legal research, managing client files, and negotiating settlements. This role honed my analytical and advocacy skills while reinforcing the importance of cultural sensitivity when assisting clients. Similarly, my role as Communications Coordinator for the University of Torontoâs Summer Abroad program allowed me to bridge cultural gaps and foster international collaboration between individuals, a skill that is essential in navigating international law. An externship in this area would present an opportunity to refine my skills, deepen my understanding of international law, and pursue my passion of advocating for global justice through legal work. I also believe that diversity drives innovation and fosters creative solutions for client problems. As a first-generation Canadian, I may bring a unique perspective to this field.",,"My interest in labour and employment law solidified during a recent firm tour, where I had the privilege of meeting labour and employment lawyers who spoke passionately about the intellectually stimulating and dynamic nature of their work.

This experience prepared me for the collaborative and client-facing aspects of labour and employment law, where maintaining strong relationships with clients and colleagues is paramount. Labour and employment law excites me because of the opportunity it presents to engage in both oral and written advocacy on a daily basis.","My interest in family law stems from my passion for increasing access to justice. Family law presents an opportunity to help individuals navigate the complexities of the legal system. My current role as an Associate Caseworker at Westernâs Community Legal Services clinic has provided me with a solid foundation in family law. Through the clinic, I have developed a deeper understanding of conducting legal research, drafting memoranda, and managing multiple client files for family law matters. The crux of my work boils down to assessing each clientâs case based on relevant legal developments to understand how to best meet their needs.

In this role, I also helped coordinate an anti-racism and decolonization leadership conference and anti-racism pilot program. As an Orientation Leader and Residence Soph, I supported young women facing mental health challenges and gender-based violence. My roles with Best Buddies Western and St. Peterâs Long Term Care deepened my understanding of the unique challenges faced by people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and those with chronic illnesses requiring long-term care. These experiences have given me an acute awareness of how the intersection of gender, age, disability, and poverty increases vulnerability to human rights abuses, equipping me to apply an intersectional approach to justice at the Human Rights Legal Support Centre.

As a Pro Bono Students Canada volunteer, I am currently researching and developing a Western Pro Bono Radio segment on evolving employment rights in the gig economy. I chose this topic to raise awareness about employment rights among women, young workers, and individuals with disabilitiesâgroups that represent a significant portion of the gig workforce. Prior to law school, I have a proven track record of leveraging my oral and written communication skills to advocate for human rights issues such as disability and age discrimination, racism and decolonization, youth mental health and poverty, and gender and 2SLGBTQIA+ equity.

This is the abhorrent reality of current-day Venezuelan outlined in a 2022 United Nations Report. In visiting Venezuela to deliver food to my grandpa during the - ongoing - Venezuelan food crisis, I recognized the grave ramifications of the law not upheld and, thus, the loss of its power.  Not only is there virtually no law when there is no accountability to the law, there is no justice, leaving communities vulnerable to unchecked abuses and systemic oppression. With family still in Venezuela, I have developed a strong interest in international law and its potential to address injustices in countries where domestic legal systems have faltered. 

My professional experiences have only increased my fascination with the complexity of legal systems. As a Junior Policy Analyst for Oneida Nation of the Thames, I became acutely aware of the challenges and nuances of intersecting legal frameworks. For example, Ontarioâs Community Safety and Policing Act's states that the enforcement of First Nationsâ bylaws is not a mandatory policing function; a position many First Nations communities view as discriminatory and a potential threat to public safety on reserves. This exposure enlightened me to the complex interactions that exist between Indigenous laws and Canadian law and sparked my curiosity about how international legal frameworks function in similarly complex and overlapping jurisdictions. 

These experiences have instilled in me a passion for exploring how international law can address systemic injustices, promote accountability, and protect vulnerable communities. I am particularly interested in the mechanisms through which international law upholds human rights and navigates the balance between state sovereignty and global responsibility. 

I hope to deepen my understanding of how international legal frameworks operate and how they can be applied to advance justice in contexts where domestic systems fall short. By pursuing international law, I hope to contribute to creating a more just world that ensures accountability, protects fundamental rights, and fosters collaboration across borders.

https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/09/venezuela-new-un-report-details-responsibilities-crimes-against-humanity","I believe that my academic and professional journey has uniquely prepared me to excel in the study and practice of environmental law. With a Bachelor of Science Honours in Biological Science and various professional experiences within the environmental sector, I have built a strong academic foundation in the environmental sciences, along with the research and writing skills necessary to succeed in this field. These experiences fueled my passion for the intersection of environmental science and law, and for environmental advocacy, particularly through legal means.  

Through courses such as âNatural Chemicals in the Environment,â âPesticides and the Environment,â âConservation Biologyâ, etc., I developed a strong academic foundation in environmental sciences during my undergraduate degree, while various research proposal projects honed my research and technical writing skills, which I have since applied in professional settings.  

 As a Research Intern for Nature Canada, I conducted extensive research on environmental advocacy, campaigning, and grassroots organizing. This work culminated in the creation of a 40+ page environmental advocacy toolkit designed to empower smaller nature organizations across Canada to advance local environmental initiatives. Similarly, as a Junior Environmental Consultant for the Oneida Nation of the Thames, I was able to apply the research and analytical skills I developed in my undergraduate studies in a professional setting; conducting in-depth research on the environmental impacts of proposed economic development projects and presenting findings to Oneidaâs Elected Chief and Council to support informed decision-making. These roles refined my research and communications skills, while providing me with a deep understanding of how evidence-based environmental advocacy can drive sustainable decision-making and development.  

With this understanding, I am now eager to explore how environmental law serves as a critical tool for advancing environmental advocacy, supporting sustainable decision-making, and ensuring compliance with environmental laws and regulations. I am particularly drawn to questions surrounding the implementation and enforcement of policies designed to combat climate change, protect biodiversity, and support Indigenous-led conservation efforts.","My interest in labour and employment law began when I first started law school during the CUPE Local 2361 strike at Western University. With daily protests near the law building and the university bringing in temporary workers to fill the roles of the striking employees, I became aware of the complex balance between workersâ rights for fair compensation and the universityâs need to maintain operations. This exposure made me curious about the role of labour and employment law in balancing these competing interests and ensuring equitable outcomes for all parties. 

This initial interest deepened in my Legal Research, Writing, and Advocacy class, where a primary focus has been vicarious liability. Exploring how employers can be held accountable for their employeesâ actions highlighted the critical need for proactive workplace policies to ensure safety and fairness. This reinforced my fascination with the complexities of labour and employment law, particularly how legal frameworks shape employer responsibilities and foster accountability. 

My professional experiences have further fueled this interest. While working as a Junior Policy Analyst for Oneida Nation of the Thames, I learned about the systemic discrimination Indigenous individuals face in accessing and retaining employment. Conversations with community members revealed barriers such as workplace bias and limited access to meaningful opportunities. These experiences heightened my awareness of how systemic inequities manifest in employment and inspired a desire to explore how labour and employment law can address such injustices without tokenizing BIPOC individuals in the workplace, and in the hiring process.  

I am particularly drawn to labour and employment lawâs potential to ensure workplace equity, address systemic discrimination, and protect vulnerable workers. By pursuing a career in this area, I hope to contribute to the development of fair and inclusive workplaces, where employees are treated with dignity and employers are held accountable to meaningful standards. With my academic background, professional experience, and growing passion for this field, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to a labour and employment law organization.","Growing up in a Christian household where divorce was often demonized, I initially viewed family breakdowns with skepticism. However, as I grew older and gained exposure to the complexities of relationships over time, I began to recognize the necessity of divorce and the critical role that family law plays in supporting individuals through these challenging times. This perspective change has instilled within me a deep interest in family law, particularly the ways in which lawyers can protect the interests of the most vulnerable partiesâespecially childrenâthroughout familial disputes.  

My professional experiences have further prepared me to handle the sensitive topics often encountered in family law. While working as a Junior Policy Analyst for Oneida Nation of the Thames, I gained invaluable experience in navigating sensitive topics, often speaking with community members about their hardships while working in a culture different than my own. On one occasion, while revising the First Nationâs Lands and Estates Policy, I was tasked with developing policies around contentious issues such as evictions, banishments, and familial disputes. This required not only strong research and analytical skills but also the ability to approach delicate topics with empathy, cultural sensitivity, and respect for diverse perspectives. These skills are highly transferable to family law, where understanding and compassion are essential. 

Additionally, my role with Oneida refined my communication skills, as I often disseminated complex information into briefing and speaking notes for Oneidaâs Elected Chief and Council. This experience demonstrated my ability to present nuanced issues clearly and effectivelyâan invaluable skill in family law, where lawyers must navigate emotionally charged situations and advocate for clients in a just manner. 

I am eager to pursue family law as a career because it provides the opportunity to support individuals during some of the most challenging times in their lives. Whether it involves helping families navigate divorce, protecting childrenâs interests, or resolving disputes with care and fairness, I am motivated to contribute meaningfully to this field. With my personal growth, transferable skills, and professional experience, I am confident in my ability to succeed in family law and make a positive impact on the lives of the individuals I come across.  ","I believe that my academic and professional journey has uniquely prepared me to excel in the study and practice of business law. With a minor in Business Economics as well as my experience in working for a startup company, I have developed a deep understanding of the necessity of legal counsel in supporting business growth and development. These experiences sparked my interest in the intersection of business and law and equipped me with the research and communication skills necessary to succeed in this field. Consequently, I am eager to pursue business law as a career path. 

During my undergraduate degree, I worked for Shiphrah Biomedical Inc., a startup company, where I gained firsthand insight into the critical role of legal counsel in supporting businesses. The CEO, unable to afford legal services, dedicated significant time to researching legal matters such as incorporation, shareholder agreements, and obtaining patentsâtime that could have been better spent on other priorities. From this exposure, I began to understand the critical role that legal counsel plays in the growth and development of businesses, solidifying my desire to work in business law. This role also provided me with the opportunity to refine my research and communication skills; as the Knowledge Translation and Marketing Lead, I conducted research to disseminate complex biomedical information into digestible language to educate our target audience.  

As a Junior Policy Analyst for Oneida Nation of the Thamesâ Political Office, I further refined these skills and was able to apply them in a commercial context. On one occasion, I was tasked with researching opportunities for Indigenous inclusion in Volkswagenâs St. Thomas, Ontario, Electric Vehicle Battery Plant as value-added companies. I then developed briefing and speaking notes for the Elected Chief and Council, preparing them for a key meeting with Ontarioâs Minister of Indigenous Affairs and Volkswagen representatives.  

With strong research and communication skills, experience applying these skills within a commercial context, and a desire to contribute to the essential role legal counsel plays in business growth and development, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to a business law organization this summer.

Through my history degree and own independent research, I have been repeatedly exposed to issues of injustice and the difficulties of holding international actors accountable. These challenges often arise from complex political, economic, and social dynamics that involve multiple stakeholders with conflicting interests. I am reminded that international legal frameworks and institutions, while essential in promoting justice, are frequently hindered by power imbalances and a lack of enforcement mechanisms. I am particularly interested in the mechanisms available in holding accountable multi-national corporations for injustices committed and exploitative business practices and if giving the opportunity would love to explore issues related to this topic.

Over the last several years, I have been an avid supporter and consumer of womenâs hockey, as well as an advocate for its equal representation with the menâs game. My family, and those around me, instilled in me a strong belief in the values of equity, diversity, and inclusivity. As a member of the Jewish community, I know what it means to be treated differently, to not feel like I belong. It is my goal to continue supporting and advocating for womenâs hockey; doing so in a professional manner as a lawyer as well. At the moment, womenâs hockey in North America is severely underfunded and undermarketed in comparison to menâs hockey. The success of the league, and womenâs hockey as a whole, is tremendously important to me. To be a part of this area of law and contribute to the striving of equal representation for those who deserve it, would truly be an honour.",,"My undergraduate degree, in Sport Management at Brock University, covered the many facets of the sport industry. These features revolve around the business side of sport, including areas such as operations, marketing, finance, and law. Throughout my undergrad, I took courses on international sport that would often cover aspects of international law. A number of courses that I was enrolled in covered international sport law as well. Due to my interest and enjoyment of the subject matter of these classes, I began thinking about law and international law, becoming more and more interested in the idea of the legal profession being my future career goal.

As a staff accountant for Marcus & Associates | Hoare Dalton, my role was to complete detailed preparation of clientsâ tax returns and financial statements. This would involve contacting the client, the clientâs investor, or the clientâs lawyer. For instance, one client was involved in a legal dispute, which meant that I had to collect all legal letters and invoices related to this dispute in order to justify the legal expenses claimed during their fiscal year. This would also have to be done in a timely manner, as there were deadlines for when the client would have to pay their corporate taxes by. I believe the skills I developed through cases such as this are considerably applicable to those required of me in this field of law.",,"As a graduate of Sport Management at Brock University, I excelled in courses on sport organizations and human resources in sport organizations. I gained considerable knowledge in labour and employment through these classes. In the Human Resources class, one of our projects involved the researching and reporting of relevant employment law to a certain human resources case that we were given. I already had an interest in law generally, but through this project, I adopted quite an interest in the area of labour and employment law. In addition to these courses, I also excelled in a course on Legal Drafting and Contract Analysis. My knowledge from this course, in combination with my first-year contracts class, significantly increased my interests in this area of law as well.

I have been able to have conversations with them about this are of law since it has always interested me. As I understand it, a lot of the work in this field of law involves the ability to have delicate conversations with clients. A requirement of my job as a staff accountant was to discuss confidential information with clients. Some of these conversations were straightforward but others involved the delicate discussion of finances and breaking unfortunate news relating to taxes to be paid. I believe these types of conversations are quite similar to those that may be required in this area of law. I have always found that I am a good listener and been the person that friends have gone to when needing to talk about difficult topics.

They had nothing when she arrived in Canada, as Jamaica prohibited them from taking any money out of the country. My family spent the first ten years squeezing ten people into a three-bedroom apartment in Toronto, relying on food stamps and goodwill to get by. Hearing about their struggles as newcomers to Canada sparked my passion for addressing issues related to immigration, housing, and poverty.
In the fourth year of my undergraduate studies, I took a seminar exploring the social impact of immigration. We analyzed the drivers of immigration to Canada, the systemic barriers newcomers face, and the societal factors perpetuating these challenges. This academic experience deepened my understanding of the complexities surrounding immigration.
After earning my BA, I worked for seven months as the Anti-Racism and Resilience Coordinator at a local nonprofit in my hometown. I collaborated with people of colour, immigrants, community organizations, and government officials to address how racism and immigration intersect with public concerns such as housing, employment, healthcare, and education. I organized a community-wide event to provide a platform for individuals to share firsthand experiences of discrimination and facilitate discussions on actionable solutions. I also implemented an anonymous reporting portal for incidents of racism, which gathered critical data and supported victims seeking to report incidents to law enforcement. This role gave me invaluable insights into the social challenges many Canadians face and the importance of policy-driven solutions.
Looking ahead, I am eager to build on this foundation by working in roles that combine public policy, advocacy, and direct community engagement. I aim to contribute to creating equitable systems that address the systemic barriers marginalized communities face. Whether through policy reform, community-based initiatives, or legal advocacy, I aspire to be part of the solution to building a more inclusive and just society.","In my undergraduate studies, I participated in many courses which examined the social impact of systemic barriers on marginalized groups. We explored issues such as economic inequality, access to justice, and the perpetuation of discrimination in institutions. This experience deepened my understanding of how social and legal systems intersect and their potential to either reinforce or dismantle inequities.

I implemented an anonymous reporting portal for incidents of hate crimes, racism and discrimination, which gathered critical data and supported victims seeking to report incidents to law enforcement. 
Additionally, I worked with temporary foreign workers and learned of systemic challenges that left many workers in precarious and potentially abusive situations. These workers come to Canada on employer-specific visas that tie their housing and employment to a single business. Many fear speaking out about mistreatment or unsafe conditions at the risk of losing their visa, housing, and ability to send money home to their families. This experience underscored the critical need for policies that protect vulnerable workers and prevent such exploitative practices.
These roles gave me invaluable insights into the structural challenges marginalized groups face and the urgent need for systemic change. 
I aspire to pursue a career in social justice and human rights law, where I can advocate for individuals facing systemic inequities and work toward policy reforms that address issues such as precarious work, housing, and access to justice. My ultimate goal is to help create systems that prioritize equity and human dignity.",,"My interest in international law stems from my passion for addressing systemic injustices and the global challenges that impact vulnerable populations. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I focused on exploring how legal systems and public policies intersect with social and environmental issues, filling my elective spots with environmental science courses to better understand the global impacts of climate change. This multidisciplinary approach has shaped my understanding of how environmental degradation exacerbates inequality, particularly for marginalized communities who often bear the brunt of its consequences.
My academic focus on environmental science and public policy has given me insight into how international environmental agreements, corporate accountability, and governmental policies can influence climate resilience and sustainability. I am particularly interested in the disproportionate effects of climate change on vulnerable populations, such as those displaced by rising sea levels, extreme weather events, or resource scarcity. Addressing these challenges requires legal frameworks that not only promote environmental sustainability but also ensure equity and justice for those most affected.
During my time as the Antiracism and Resilience Coordinator at a local nonprofit, I worked with marginalized communities, government officials, and organizations to address systemic barriers in areas such as housing, employment, and education. I worked with temporary foreign workers, uncovering the precarious conditions many face under employer-specific visas. These visas tied their housing, employment, and legal status to a single business, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Workers often feared speaking out due to the risk of losing their visas, housing, and the ability to support their families back home. This experience highlighted the urgent need for stronger protections in international labor migration policies and reinforced my desire to work on issues that cross borders and impact global communities.
Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue a career in international law focused on the intersection of human rights, environmental policy, and global public policy. I am particularly interested in how international legal frameworks can be leveraged to promote sustainability, equity, and justice.","My passion for environmental policy stems from a deep concern for climate change and its global impacts. Growing up in British Columbia, I have witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of climate change. While I have not been directly impacted by the forest fire crises that ravage the province every summer, I have experienced the persistent anxiety that accompanies the season. The summer months are marked by the constant monitoring of nearby fires, with regular reminders to pack a suitcase of our most valued possessions and place them by the door so that we can evacuate at a moment's notice. As an individual, you feel helpless in preventing the inevitable damage. This sense of helplessness in the face of inevitable destruction made it clear to me that the consequences of climate change are not distant or abstractâthey are urgent and personal.
It is particularly frustrating to hear individuals and corporations downplay the need for behavioural change, citing convenience as a barrier to reducing environmental impact. At the same time, corporations remain too focused on economic interests, failing to consider the broader, long-term consequences of their actions on both local communities and the planet. This frustration has only strengthened my resolve to pursue a career dedicated to mitigating the harmful effects of climate change.
Throughout my undergraduate studies, I intentionally pursued a multidisciplinary approach, majoring in criminology/sociology while filling my elective courses with environmental science to understand climate change's scientific, social, and policy dimensions better. 
I am particularly interested in exploring how environmental law and policy can hold corporations and governments accountable for their role in climate change. Effective policy must prioritize environmental sustainability and ensure that the most affected communities are protected and empowered. My goal is to work on developing and enforcing policies that incentivize meaningful change, promote sustainability, and ensure that corporations and governments are held accountable for their contributions to climate-related harm.","My interest in employment and labour law stems from my experience working with temporary foreign workers and ODSP applicants. 
As the Anti-racism and Resilience Coordinator at the Whistler Multicultural Society, I worked with temporary foreign workers, learning about the systemic challenges that left many workers in precarious and potentially abusive situations. These workers come to Canada on closed work permits that tie their employment to a single business. Many fear speaking out about mistreatment or unsafe conditions at the risk of losing their visa, housing, and ability to send money home to their families. This experience showed me the critical need for policies that protect vulnerable workers and prevent such exploitative practices.
I currently volunteer with the Elgin-Oxford Legal Clinic, working on Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) claims and appeals. In this capacity, I assist individuals who are navigating the complexities of the social assistance system, providing support to those who are often marginalized or facing significant barriers to accessing the benefits they need. This work has strengthened my skills in client advocacy and navigating administrative processes and has deepened my understanding of the challenges vulnerable populations face in securing the rights and benefits they are entitled to.

While volunteering at Mobilizing for Milton-Parc, I assisted in a student-led mutual-aid solidarity project to provide marginalized groups with essential items. By collaborating with local homeless shelters and churches to plan meal distribution and reach community members, I understand more about these communities and their unique needs. I realized the current approaches do not go far enough to satisfy their particular needs. As a result, I have become particularly interested in how the law can both exacerbate and alleviate these challenges. This further piqued my interest in utilizing public law to address the gaps in housing policies, inadequacies of healthcare, and other social issues. These are topics that I am eager to explore further throughout my research and with the aid of a formal organization. 

My desire to pursue a position within the area of Public Interest is driven by my aspiration to contribute to positive systemic change. By advocating for reform in these areas, I aim to generate lasting and impactful change. Law offers the opportunity to contribute to this on a broader scale. Through my academic and extracurricular experience, I am certain I would be an ideal candidate for this goal. My background in community aid and my experience witnessing the impact of gaps in social aid provide me with a unique perspective on the urgency of legal solutions for these programs. ","My interest in Social Justice and Human Rights Law stems from my experiencing seeing the much-needed change within the Canadian school systems. Coming out of high school, I was fortunate to know how to file taxes and budget my income thanks to my parents, who took it upon themselves to teach me. My mother, a teacher, recognized the gaps in our school system and ensured I was well prepared to survive university in an increasingly complex economy. Speaking with my friends, I realized how many lacked these basic skills, feeling paralyzed with financial stress. After recognizing this widespread lack of financial education, I sought opportunities at my undergraduate university, where I found an organization that greatly impacted my university experience: PennyDrops.
PennyDrops is a non-profit organization dedicated to empowering Canadian youth through financial education. It allows students to achieve financial independence with its teaching programs conducted in both high schools and universities. As Senior Director of Operations on the National Team, I was responsible for the McGill, TMU, and UofT chapters. I coordinated outreach to identify teaching opportunities and collaborated with teachers to implement our financial workshops. During my time there, we reached and educated over 4,700 students, allowing me to impact our communities through much needed change within the Canadian school systems. Although this is just one activity that I have been involved in over the past 4 years, it provided me with experience advocating for educational reform. This is an experience that greatly influenced my view of social justice in our society and showed me the need for greater access to education.
As I have grown to understand the shortcomings of Canadian education in teaching financial education to students, I have become driven to pursue education reform through revised curricula and collaboration with policymakers. With the experience PennyDrops gave me, I am excited to continue this pursuit throughout my future legal career.",,"My passion for engaging with other cultures and countries has fueled my interest in International Law. Having closely studied International Business and the Law of the Sea both at McGill and in France, I am eager to apply my knowledge and curious to learn more while in a professional setting. 

While participating in an academic exchange in France, I witnessed the wide array of differences in virtually every aspect of life be it politically, socially, economically, or legally. Having learned more about these fundamental differences, I find it fascinating to explore how international legal frameworks bridge the gaps between diverse systems and promote cooperation on an international level. Specifically, I am interested in how trade agreements, treaties, and international organizations can bridge these differences.

My interest in International Law deepened as I studied International Business Law and the Law of the Sea. International Business Law allowed me to gain a better understanding of how cultural norms govern international trade and law. Understanding the cross-cultural differences between parties involved in an international business transaction is critical to effective communication and overall success. The Law of the Sea demonstrated the importance of treaties and international agreements for international actors and legal compliance. While I studied these in an academic setting, I am keen to apply my knowledge in a real-world context. 

I am motivated to pursue a career in International Law because I believe it provides a unique opportunity to tackle issues that concern multiple countries. Furthermore, due to the multiple facets of International Law, I can contribute to positive, lasting change on a global scale. By addressing and working on matters that cross international borders, my goal is to use my legal skills to advocate on pressing issues. I look forward to applying the research, analytical, and problem-solving skills Iâve developed throughout my studies and extracurricular experiences in an international legal setting, and I am excited to continue learning from experts in the field.",,,,"Business Law is the category about which I am the most passionate. My interest in the topic stems from my academic experience and experience completing legal work for an entrepreneur. 

Having a Bachelorâs Degree in Commerce, I am eager to apply my knowledge of Business and learn more about the realm of Business Law. Due to my current role as a 1L Caseworker at the Western Business Law Clinic (WBLC) and previous work experience, I have hands-on experience with the intersection between Business and Law. In addition, through my experience in various business and corporate settings, I believe that I am a strong candidate for a Business Law position.

At the WBLC, I work directly with an entrepreneur to help him succeed in the marketplace. By providing him with legal assistance and materials to suit his businessâ unique needs, I have been able to do client-facing work in an area of law that greatly interests me. I am passionate about understanding each aspect of his business and the climate in which he is operating to provide him with the best possible service. This role has affirmed my desire to pursue a career in Business Law.

Furthermore, I am curious to learn more about the lawâs role in helping businesses succeed long-term. As I have only been working with my client for the past semester, and because he is still in the start-up phase, I have only seen a glimpse into Business Law. I am particularly interested in taking part in areas such as mergers and acquisitions and commercial transactions. Having studied these areas extensively throughout my Undergraduate Degree, I am fascinated in taking part in the legal side of these types of transactions. Additionally, I am interested in learning more about the legal side of corporate governance and its effects on social responsibility, ethical practices, and long-term sustainability.

I am eager to continue developing my legal skills in the context of Business Law. I look forward to a career in which I can assist clients and navigate the legal and business landscape.","I became interested in Intellectual Property (IP) Law while working at the Western Business Law Clinic. My client is an entrepreneur who runs a start-up and is currently navigating the complexities of legal protection. In speaking with him, I have realized the importance of IP protection for businesses and individuals seeking to guard their assets. Through this relationship, I have become more interested in IP Law in an era where technology is constantly evolving. Wanting to pursue Business or International Law throughout my career, I believe experience with IP Law would be a valuable asset.

During my undergraduate degree I took many Disability Studies courses, allowing me to reflect more deeply on the social and legal injustices people with disabilities face in our province. My in-class learning was further enhanced by my time working at Participation House Support Services (PHSS) in London as a support worker for people with disabilities, giving me the opportunity to take what I had learned in the classroom and apply it in my job. I have developed a comprehensive understanding of the challenges people with disabilities encounter in our province including higher rates of poverty, challenges in accessing care, and inaccessible transit and public spaces to name just a few. I would like to be involved with legal work that helps to remedy these kinds of issues and provides justice to people with disabilities in Ontario. 

Additionally, I am very interested in contributing to organizations that work to provide housing to those living in poverty or who are unhoused. I firmly believe that housing is a right to which all individuals are entitled. As rent prices have significantly increased across much of our province, I believe that it is more important than ever to advocate for increased affordable housing and ensure that individuals seeking housing are as supported and informed as possible. Ultimately, I am excited about the possibility of taking part in an externship this summer with an organization that promotes access to justice, particularly for marginalized groups. I hope to pursue a legal career in public interest law and am enthusiastic about the opportunity to explore what working in this field could look like. 
","I have a strong interest in participating in a social justice and human rights law externship this upcoming summer. I would particularly love to work for an organization that supports incarcerated individuals and/or which seeks to improve our criminal justice system in Canada. In a number of my undergraduate courses I had the opportunity to examine systems of institutionalization and incarceration in Canada. These classes discussed how racialized communities, particularly Black and Indigenous communities, in Canada tend to be over-policed and experience overrepresentation in our prison system as well as the impacts this incarceration can have. I believe strongly in eliminating barriers to justice and providing underserved communities with legal resources and legal education. I also believe that discussions around crime are entirely tied to discussions of socio-economics and particularly to poverty. While helping individuals to navigate our criminal justice system is critical, providing resources and representation, I believe working to create a more equitable society is first key in reforming this system. I truly hope to have the opportunity to learn more about social justice and human rights law to understand what a career in this field might look like. ",,"I have a strong interest in working in international law and exploring the function of international organizations and courts. During my undergraduate degree in political science I took a number of courses related to international law. In these courses I had the opportunity to examine the gendered impacts of international law and international institutions, particularly following armed conflict, mass atrocities and genocides. In a course on international law and organizations, I was able to give a presentation on the International Criminal Courtâs Trust Fund for Victims. Another extremely impactful course I took in my fourth year was called âGender and the Internationalâ and it truly shaped the lens through which I view gender narratives in conflict, as well as giving me greater insight into the ways in which gender and gendered issues are treated in law, UN resolutions, foreign policy, and media. 

Additionally, I had the incredible opportunity to take part in an experiential learning course which involved travelling to Rwanda in 2023 to study the peace-building and reconciliation processes that have occurred there since the genocide against the Tutsi in 1994. My group heard from genocide survivors, visited memorials and NGOs and learned about Rwandaâs recovery over the past 30 years. Following the trip, each student wrote a 4,000-word essay on a specific topic surrounding the genocide and peace-building/reconciliation process. I was particularly interested in learning more about the role of gender in the genocide and chose to centre my essay on the connection between gender and sexual violence and explored the effectiveness of Rwandaâs Gacaca Courts in prosecuting the acts of sexual violence and rape that took place during the genocide against the Tutsi. In examining how effective these courts were in providing justice for survivors of such crimes I also had the opportunity to research the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). I am passionate about exploring international law in greater depth, especially in how it relates to gender and conflict.",,"Labour and employment law is of great interest to me and I could certainly see myself pursuing a career in this area after law school. I am deeply interested in the nature of employment relationships and exploring law that protects workers in Ontario. In my legal research class this year, a number of our assignments have focused on employment contracts and various employment related issues. One issue that I found particularly interesting was exploring the impacts of non-disclosure agreements on workers and how public opinion on NDAs in some circumstances has changed, particularly when harassment has occurred. I am passionate about ensuring that workers are well informed on what is in their contracts, what rights they have, and what benefits they are entitled to. As well, I am interested in learning more about labour and employment law from an employers perspective. Ensuring employers are fully aware of what their duties and responsibilities are to workers not only protects them but stops violations of workersâ rights in the first place. 
","Family law is not an area of law that I have explored in depth during my 1L year but it is a field I am curious about and could potentially see myself working in one day. Family lawyers are critical in our legal system, helping families, former spouses, children, and parents, navigate what are often extremely emotional and complex life events. One aspect of family law that I am very interested in is fertility and reproductive law. As more and more Canadians choose to build their families using the help of reproductive technologies, donation, and surrogacy or have parenting agreements or family structures that may not be well-recognized in law, it is critical that family lawyers are able to support individuals in navigating these processes. I am also very interested in Canadian law surrounding issues like donor conception and surrogacy which is quite different to American law. I had the opportunity in my undergraduate classes to explore Canada's Assisted Human Reproduction Act as well as explore different ethical perspectives on issues relating to reproductive technologies in a bioethics course I took. Finally, I am interested in speaking to and networking with family lawyers and gaining a deeper understanding of the work they do and why they chose to work in this area of law. I believe this work would be very rewarding and would like to learn more about what kinds of legal issues I might encounter in a career in family law.",,,1035465.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3L5ci4GoHJjzzQ9,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3PMJLyupyWyyxaN,"London, ON and Toronto, ON","In-Person,Hybrid",,,,,,,,,

During my undergrad, I pursued multiple opportunities that would allow me to explore the intersection between business and the law, including working on my schoolâs Business Law Association. My role entailed providing students with opportunities to explore their interest in law through creating a mentorship program, various networking opportunities, and learning about different career paths. This role enabled me to help others find their passion within the law, and exposed me to different ways I could use my law degree in the future. Additionally, in talking to an attorney at a CSR Conference I organized, I learned more about how I could leverage my responsible business background with a law degree to help draft corporate policies that benefit society. Currently, I am an executive on Westernâs Business Law Society, which has provided me ample opportunities to further develop my understanding on the intersection between business and the law, as well as explore different career opportunities including new pathways that have risen as a result of technological advances, such as in the field of AI.  

My experiences have enabled me to understand how to create and effectively operate successful business practices. With my knowledge of corporate governance and regulatory compliance, as taught to me through my responsible business specialization, I believe I will be able to serve clients in a way that benefits them while simultaneously invoking positive change within their surrounding communities. Though I am not yet knowledgeable on the depth of the roles lawyers play in regards to business law, I am eager to learn more about this area of the law, beginning with taking corporate law during my first year of law school. I am hoping the knowledge I gain through this course, and the experience I attain through working in this area of the law, will allow me to determine the best use of my business degree in supporting the use of my law degree. ","With an undergraduate degree in business, I have a particular interest in exploring intellectual property law. Though this area of the law may typically be associated with a science background, I believe the experiences I have gained through my entrepreneurship and responsible business specializations within my business degree help me understand the true value of protecting the rights of creators and owners of intellectual property. Within my entrepreneurship courses, I learned about the path business owners take to launch new products and services, as well as the struggles they endure as a result of this process. Under my responsible business specialization, I learned different ways responsible business practices can positively impact the field of IP law, such as through: enforcing IP rights, treating IP as a business asset, and using IP in negotiations. Additionally, the responsible business practices I have studied, have enabled me to gain a better understanding on how IP law can promote creativity and the public interest while simultaneously rewarding creators. This also includes encouraging businesses to contribute to sustainable development while avoiding the adverse impacts of their operations. 

While I still have a lot to learn regarding the processes used to protect intellectual property rights, as well as the specific roles lawyers play in interacting with creators, I believe my background will serve as an asset in meeting the needs of clients. Understanding the true value of a creatorâs work, as well as the process used to launch a successful business in relation to the IP right, will go a long way in showing clientâs I have their best interest at heart. While I am still unsure of the type of law I want to practice, I know the skills I have developed and experiences I have gained through my business background will underlie the use of my law degree. I am hoping that through gaining experience in the intellectual property law sector, I will be able to determine the best use of my business degree in serving creators of intellectual property.

Throughout my time at uOttawa, social justice and human rights were explored in my classes through an international lens. Although I have always been passionate about social justice and human rights, my courses introduced me to its politicized counterpart. Through my coursework, I gained a nuanced understanding of how politics can influence the maintenance and dissemination of human rights within a particular country and how that alters international relations. For example, a research project on international human rights law deepened my awareness of international efforts to preserve social justice and protect vulnerable populations. Additionally, studying Track Two diplomacy highlighted the critical role that conflict resolution plays in achieving sustainable social justice. Consequently, I was also exposed to the deficiencies of the political and legal systems in protecting and safeguarding human rights. 
	In a polarized and volatile socio-political climate, the study of social justice and human rights law will prove to be very valuable. The study of social justice and human rights law is essential in addressing systemic inequalities, safeguarding marginalized communities, and cultivating resilient institutions that bolster equity and fairness. Future legal practitioners should be well-versed in this field and be prepared to uproot existing social systems of oppression. As someone who is deeply committed to fostering inclusivity and equity, I view the law as a powerful tool for challenging injustice and a mechanism for invoking change. In pursuing a career in this field, I hope to leverage my legal education to address the shortcomings of existing frameworks that strive to preserve social justice and human rights. I am eager to apply my academic training and deepen my understanding of how the law can serve as a vehicle for advancing equity and preserving human rights in Canada and beyond.",,"     Graduating magna cum laude with an Honours Bachelor of Social Sciences in Conflict Studies and Human Rights, along with a minor in Health Sciences from the University of Ottawa, has equipped me with a strong foundation to navigate the complexities of international law. With a substantial emphasis on international law, my coursework at uOttawa allowed me to explore an unanticipated passion: legal implications on international relations. Although I have always been passionate about social justice and human rights, my courses introduced me to its politicized counterpart. I gained a nuanced understanding of how politics can influence the maintenance and dissemination of human rights within a country and how that alters international relations. For example, a research project on international human rights law deepened my awareness of international efforts to preserve social justice and protect vulnerable populations. Even though this project focused on womenâs rights in Afghanistan under Taliban rule, a recurring pattern was evident â despite its importance, international laws often lack adequate enforcement mechanisms, rendering them insufficient to address systemic injustices. Additionally, studying Track Two diplomacy highlighted the critical role that international law plays in achieving sustainable conflict resolution. However, my research in this area of international law also reiterated the need for more robust legal structures that apply to all actors in the international sphere.  
	In a highly polarized and volatile socio-political climate, the study of international law will prove to be very valuable. Public and private international law will continue to remain essential in guiding nations through challenging global crises like climate change, disease outbreaks, and armed conflict. As someone who is deeply committed to pursuing a career that enables me to foster sustainable peace and cooperation in an international arena, I view the law as a powerful tool for challenging injustice and a mechanism for invoking change. I hope to leverage my interdisciplinary education to address the shortcomings of existing international frameworks and help to build an international system that emulates inclusivity and cooperation. I am eager to enhance my understanding of how the law can advance collective goals and create lasting solutions for global challenges. ",,,"      Graduating magna cum laude with an Honours Bachelor of Social Sciences in Conflict Studies and Human Rights, along with a minor in Health Sciences from the University of Ottawa, has equipped me with a nuanced understanding of interpersonal dynamics, sustainable conflict resolution, and the importance of protecting fundamental rights. My academic background has cultivated my ability to navigate the complex and sensitive landscape of family law. While my academic focus was largely on conflict resolution in international contexts, many of the skills that I have developed throughout my time at uOttawa are highly applicable to resolving interpersonal conflicts. For instance, my coursework on conflict resolution introduced me to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as mediation and negotiation. I was initially inspired to pursue family law after taking âTrack Two Diplomacyâ at uOttawa in my fourth year. This course broadened my understanding of mediation under a political lens and highlighted the importance of an objective third-party in emotionally charged disputes. My academic career has allowed me to develop an appreciation for the pivotal role that authentic and honest dialogue can play in resolving conflict and promoting amicable outcomes for the parties involved.  
	Beyond academia, I have witnessed the transformative impact of family law through personal and professional experiences. As an Associate Caseworker at the Community Legal Services Clinic in London, Ontario, I have had the opportunity to assist with family law files. My responsibilities include drafting correspondence, attending court appearances, and assisting with client intake. This opportunity has provided me with hands-on experience in the legal field, but has also exposed me to several concerns that future practitioners should consider before practicing in family law. It is evident that systemic barriers â such as financial instability or inaccessibility of legal resources â disproportionately impact marginalized communities, influencing the outcomes of legal proceedings. Additionally, claimants in family law are typically navigating extreme personal hardships. With these observations, it is vital that family law practitioners act with compassion and prioritize accessibility and equity. As a future family lawyer, I hope to empower individuals and help to cultivate healthy familial relationships.  ","     Graduating magna cum laude with an Honours Bachelor of Social Sciences in Conflict Studies and Human Rights, along with a minor in Health Sciences from the University of Ottawa, has equipped me with an interdisciplinary perspective and a strong foundation for navigating the dynamic field of business law. My academic background, while rooted in the social sciences, offered a unique opportunity to explore the intersections between law, economics, and social structures. Through my courses, I learned more about legal and ethical considerations that govern both public and private sector interactions. For example, studying conflict resolution in an international context enhanced my ability to analyze complex disputes and evaluate frameworks that foster amicable outcomes for all stakeholders involved. In my fourth year, I had the opportunity to study âTrack Two Diplomacyâ which taught me more about negotiation and the power of authentic dialogue in dispute resolution. These skills, when applied to business law, are essential for resolving interpersonal disputes and facilitating contractual negotiation. 
	Beyond academics, my professional experience has provided me with hands-on exposure to the practical application of business principles. As a Stylist and Cash Lead at Levi Strauss & Co., I had the opportunity to gain invaluable insights into the operational and managerial aspects of a globally recognized brand. My responsibilities included facilitating transactions with clients, training newer employees, and ensuring compliance with company policy. This experience deepened my appreciation for the complexities of running a business and sparked my interest in sales. I learned that I want to pursue a career that is client-oriented â I am particularly interested in exploring mergers and acquisitions, where negotiation and transaction play a pivotal role in business growth and sustainability. As a social science major, this was an unanticipated shift in my career trajectory; however, I am confident that my experiences have adequately prepared me for a career in business law. With a meticulous understanding of conflict resolution, attention to detail, and a passion for justice, I hope to contribute meaningfully to a legal system that lends itself to sustainable and ethical business practices.   ","     Graduating magna cum laude with an Honours Bachelor of Social Sciences in Conflict Studies and Human Rights, along with a minor in Health Sciences from the University of Ottawa, has uniquely prepared me to navigate the complex legal landscape of intellectual property. The study of conflict studies and human rights is extremely multifaceted and explores several different disciplines. In my third and fourth year, I had the opportunity to analyze transnational copyright and patent laws, determining how they intermingle with public international law. When studying health sciences, mentions of intellectual property and innovation were ubiquitous. I found the study of intellectual property and patents with respect to medical discoveries extremely fascinating. The health science field is plagued with innovative public health frameworks and mechanisms that are utilized to modify and enhance the quality of life for many individuals. 
     Apart from my educational endeavours, I have encountered intellectual property law in other areas of my life. As a dancer and content creator, I had to familiarize myself with intellectual property rights and trademarks in the artistic sphere. Bollywood dance in Calgary, Alberta (my hometown) is a small yet competitive market. From analyzing intellectual property clauses in performance contracts to investigating trademark laws for signature dance steps, the performing arts sphere is often intertwined with intellectual property considerations. In todayâs digital age, it has become increasingly important to ensure that creativity and innovation can flourish while safeguarding and protecting the rights of creators and innovators. By leveraging my interdisciplinary education and personal experiences, I hope to address pressing issues as a future practitioner in the field of intellectual property, such as the implications of emerging medical technologies and the protection of cultural heritage. I am eager to enhance my understanding of the intricacies of intellectual property law and how it can be utilized to protect innovation and creativity in various domains.

I spent my undergraduate degree engaging in experiential learning opportunities and studying an array of subjects, from housing and homelessness to urban planning processes and the lived experiences of frontline workers. 

Before and during university, I volunteered and completed a placement with Art City in St. James Town, Toronto, which provides free after-school arts programming to youth. St. James Town is the largest high-rise community in Canada, where most residents are recent immigrants and visible minorities who face discrimination and live below the poverty line. Upon research and reflection, I concluded that in addition to fostering creativity, Art City acts as a safe space that fosters self-worth, encourages experimentation in a way that makes students feel capable of tackling challenges, and helps students build social capital and a sense of belonging through the formation of strong connections that counter the harmful effects of discrimination. Together, these missions encourage resilience by providing youth with a sense of control over their lives and help create a more promising future for children living in the city.

Currently, I am thrilled that I have the chance to bridge urban studies with law. In September, I joined Pro Bono Students Canada, where I am creating plain language internal resources for Support and Hope for Individuals and Families Today (SHIFT) in New Tecumseth that will help the organization support their clients in navigating housing law in Ontario. Specifically, I am researching No-Fault and Early Termination for Cause (Can Fix) evictions under the Residential Tenancies Act.

Public Interest law is a field I have always been drawn to, both for its focus on community service and emphasis on community-based learning. I am interested in working for organizations that value the lived experiences and leadership of community members, commit to understanding their visions, and strive to build strong networks and relationships, as these environments can help lawyers and law students better respond to client needs, develop culturally-sensitive legal approaches that contribute to a more inclusive society, and lay the foundation for positive social change. ","Of the many courses I took at the University of Toronto, two stand out in particular: The Divided / United City and Housing and Homelessness II: Behind the Frontline on Urban Homelessness. Both courses shed light on the prevalent issue of housing discrimination in Toronto, and as a law student with the opportunity to work in social justice and human rights fields, I am interested in exploring the ways in which legal action can respond to and tackle issues of discrimination, and more specifically, housing discrimination. 

A statistic I learned from my professor, David Hulchanski, which I have never forgotten, is that 73 per cent of residents in high-income Toronto neighbourhoods are white, while white people account for just 31 per cent of residents in low-income neighbourhoods. For this reason, among others, Professor Hulchanski explained that there is a high degree of residential segregation in Toronto. While it can be voluntary through the existence of cultural enclaves, it is largely involuntary, and both race and socio-economic status play a role in the pattern. 

Further reading and research revealed that discrimination fuels and exacerbates the problem. Economic criteria are often used to exclude certain groups from housing, which is problematic, as incomes for racialized groups have not been adjusted to inflation. Landlords also often reject those living on social assistance. Combined, these factors limit housing options.

When I had the opportunity to ask two guest-speakers in my class on the lived experiences of frontline workers who are frontline workers themselves about what they do when they suspect that their clients are experiencing housing discrimination, they explained that it is often ânot worth the fightâ and they feel as though they have no choice but to keep seeking out other options. It is for this reason that I am interested in social justice and human rights law and addressing housing discrimination. I am curious to explore how to make legal pathways more accessible to communities in need and how legal action can lead to cultural shifts that help contribute to a more just and inclusive society.",,,"I have always taken a keen interest in the environment. Throughout my undergraduate degree, I took courses on water resource management, extractivism in Latin America and its effects on the environment and Indigenous communities, and the global food system. I also explored this interest through the G7 Research Group at the University of Toronto, which is a global network of scholars, professionals, and students on a mission to serve as the worldâs leading source of independent source of information, analysis, and research on the G7. 

In my role as a Compliance Analyst at the G7 research group, I researched Canada and the European Unionâs compliance with their food and agriculture resilience and sustainability summit commitments for the G7 Elmau Compliance Cycle and contributed to two online publications. My participation in the group helped me acquire skills that have assisted me in my legal studies and will assist me in the legal profession. In my role as a Compliance Analyst, I conducted thorough research on government websites, followed interpretive guidelines, and adhered to a strict writing and citation style that enhanced the consistency of the overall report. Attending meetings, meeting deadlines during the school year, and clearly communicating my questions and progress was a top priority of mine, and it reinforced the importance of accountability and collaboration in a professional setting. 

My specific interest in environmental law was sparked through the course I took on extractivism in Latin America, which culminated in a research paper on environmental law in Bolivia. The paper explored the extent to which laws including the 2009 Bolivian Constitution and The Law of the Rights of Mother Earthâa piece of legislation that conferred rights upon natureâincorporate Indigenous principles and challenge ideas of nature as an exploitable resource.

This combination of research and academic study has solidified my interest in environmental law and illuminated the potential for environmental law to address global challenges in unique ways. I am eager to contribute to a field that uses the law to foster sustainable development, protect vulnerable communities, and strike a balance between economic goals and environmental stewardship.",,,"My interest in business law stems from my background in Political Science and Urban Studies, as business law invariably shapes the local and global economies by supporting economic growth, protecting consumers, and navigating emerging areas in finance. Since starting my legal education at Western, I have come to appreciate the creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking involved in contract creation and legal decision-making, and I am motivated by the challenges and learning opportunities that arise from aligning legal decisions with business goals. 

Gaining exposure to a diverse field that is constantly evolving due to globalization, technological advancements, and the rise of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations is exciting, as it will equip me with the skills necessary to navigate complex legal areas and illuminate the ways in which the law addresses emerging challenges. I am also eager to deepen my understanding of the regulations and legislation that govern the business and financial sectors at international, domestic, and local levels. For these reasons, I am taking Corporate Law in 1L, and I am interested in the Business Law Stream. 

I am specifically interested in the growing emphasis on ESG considerations and the role that legal innovation can play in balancing competing interests, such as compliance with regulatory changes, stakeholder demands, and remaining competitive. More broadly, I am drawn to the opportunities for advocacy that come with ESG initiatives in the business realm and how the law plays an a role in protecting societal interests. 

Since April 2021, I have independently contracted with a Korean-based tutoring company and provided over one thousand one-on-one English lessons to professionals and university students, many of whom became repeat students. This role has strengthened my communication skills, as active listening, clarity, and non-verbal communication are all essential to a studentâs success. This role also requires cultural-sensitivity, and by fostering cross-cultural communication and creating a comfortable learning environment, I have helped students excel. I am confident that the interpersonal skills I have developed in this role will transfer to professional client-facing and collaborative work environments.","I began thinking about Intellectual Property (IP) Law when I spent a summer interning at AgeRate, which is a company that has developed an at-home test to inform users of their biological age, measure key health indicators, and provide personalized recommendations on how to decrease oneâs biological age. While my role focused on managing the LinkedIn page, copyediting, and creating newsletters for investors, I remained fascinated by the innovation that was taking place right before my eyes and wondered how this biotechnology start-up was going to protect its innovations while it embarked on a mission to boost longevity. 

This fascination further sparked curiosity about the intersection of Health Law and IP Law. By gaining exposure to IP law, I hope to learn more about the ways in which IP law either balances or fuels the competing interests of innovators, consumers, and society as a whole. I am intrigued by the role IP law plays in safeguarding cutting-edge innovations, like those in the biotechnology space, while upholding societal interests by making important technological advancements accessible. 

On a broader level, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted me to consider the relationship between IP law and global health. I am interested in exploring how IP law incentivizes research and development, and I am eager to deepen my understanding of the legal challenges that arise when there is a pressing demand for a product during times when the need to scale production is high. I am also curious about the role IP law plays in incentivizing research and development in areas that are less conventional and how it may promote or stifle equitable access to healthcare in different parts of the world.",140614.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_A4mtVqh9tjmHdJf,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2RQSXXs6ZLLDjvI,"1.

My work in fundraising and communicating with donors allowed me to alleviate their financial and mental stress, reinforcing my desire to ease the burdens people face when navigating systems that feel overwhelming or inaccessible.

As a bartender this past summer, I interacted with hundreds of customers daily, multitasking during busy rushes while maintaining personable and professional service. As an accounting/administrative associate at an international wood stain supplier for the two summers prior, I was often the first point of contact for dealers across Canada and the United States, coordinating complex order details and resolving logistical challenges. I thrived having this high level of responsibility and working closely with other departments.

I graduated from Queenâs University with a Bachelor in Commerce. One of the most impactful courses I took was âIntroduction to Human Resources Managementâ, where I learned about employee rights and regulations, employersâ occupational health and safety responsibilities, labour relations and collective bargaining, and dispute resolutions. I also participated in an in-class arbitration hearing which I thoroughly enjoyed. While I was already planning to attend law school, this course, along with others such as âBusiness Ethicsâ and âOrganizational Behaviourâ, sparked my interest in labour and employment law as a potential career path. Consequently, I chose electives like âNegotiation Theory & Behaviourâ and âWork and Social Inequitiesâ, which were two of my favourite undergraduate courses. These classes reinforced my curiosity about how the law can address workplace conflicts, power dynamics, and systemic inequities. They deepened my desire to help individuals and organizations navigate complex workplace challenges. I can envision myself resolving disputes that profoundly affect peopleâs lives.

While I will further my studies in this field through the Labour, Employment, and Social Justice Stream at Western Law, my passion also stems from a deeply personal experience.

In March of 2022, while trying to repair equipment, he fell off a 10-foot barn ladder, breaking his back in four critical places and damaging his spinal cord. I watched him go through surgery, physiotherapy and a lengthy recovery, all while his employer failed to report the injury and fix the equipment. This strengthened my resolve to pursue a career where I can use my education and background to make a difference. I am interested in advocating for individuals like my father by ensuring that policies and legislation are in place to protect workers and that employers are held accountable for providing safe working conditions.

I developed strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and expertise in their niche industry, working collaboratively with other departments to meet customer needs. This experience, paired with my academic background, reinforced my interest in business law as a field where I can combine my skills in analysis and communication with my passion for helping organizations solve complex problems. 

My involvement with Queenâs Commerce Law Association was also pivotal in reinforcing my interest in business law. I was a part of the club for three years and was Co-Chair during my final year, leading the team to deliver networking events, panels, Toronto law firm tours, a mock trial, and a 3-day trip to New York City. Through these initiatives, I connected with lawyers practicing in various areas of business law, which broadened my understanding of potential career paths and helped me identify practice areas where I could thrive. Leading the club also honed my decision-making, research, and interpersonal skills â qualities I look forward to developing further to support future clients.
 
This combination of academic, professional, and extracurricular experience has prepared me to pursue a career in business law, where I can make a meaningful impact.","While earning my undergraduate degree in Commerce at Queenâs University, I obtained a Certificate in Law, in which I completed an Intellectual Property Law course. This course introduced me to patents, trademarks, and copyright law, sparking an interest in a future pathway for myself that I had not previously considered. I thoroughly enjoyed the content and therefore would love the opportunity to hone my legal skills outside of the classroom in this subject area I am passionate about exploring.
 
My summer work at an international wood stain supplier also introduced me to managing high stakes commercial relationships and gave me experience in intricate order calculations and strong cross-departmental communication. I spent two summers there as an accounting/administrative associate, in which I was often the first point of contact for hundreds of dealers primarily across Canada and the United States who were requesting high volumes of product to be shipped to them by specific times.

I developed strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail and a collaborative approach as I worked closely with other departments to coordinate order details, speciality bookings, and delivery schedules. I thrived on the responsibility of ensuring customer satisfaction while balancing challenging requests and pressing deadlines in a professional setting. My ability to quickly grasp complex, specialized knowledge in this niche industry reflects my commitment to mastering new concepts, which I am eager to apply to helping organizations solve complex problems.
 
My involvement in Queenâs Commerce Kids reaffirmed the importance of teamwork and community impact to me, as I organized classroom volunteers and participated in food drives for food banks and fundraising activities for SickKids. It was deeply motivating to know that my commitment supported important causes and enhanced young individualsâ learning experiences. This commitment to making a meaningful impact inspires me to support clients while exploring my interest in intellectual property law. I am eager to help protect innovative ideas and promote creativity from my local community, while ensuring equitable outcomes for individuals and businesses as I develop my expertise in this dynamic field.

My passion for helping underserved communities and my academic background have laid the foundation for my desire to engage in meaningful legal work.

During my time at Queen's University, where I earned multiple scholarships for my academic excellence in economics, I developed a strong understanding of the economic and social factors that contribute to inequality. My high academic standing has given me the analytical skills necessary to assess complex issues, while my work as President of the Queen's Economics Society honed my leadership and communication skills, as I organized speaker events and collaborated with diverse groups. These experiences shaped my awareness of the importance of public interest law in addressing disparities in society.

At Girones Bourdon Kelly Lawyers, I gained hands-on legal experience, including conducting legal research, drafting documents, and assisting with client intakes. While working with clients, I recognized the profound impact that legal representation can have on individuals navigating issues like housing disputes and financial hardship. This reinforced my commitment to pursuing legal work that not only upholds the rule of law but also supports those who lack access to resources.

In addition to my academic and legal experiences, my background as a wildland firefighter taught me the values of teamwork, resilience, and working in high-pressure situations, which will be invaluable in the world of public interest law. 

This externship offers the ideal platform for me to further develop my legal skills while working toward social justice and advocating for those in need.","I am deeply committed to advocating for social justice, and I see a social justice externship as an ideal opportunity to build on my academic background and work experiences while actively contributing to causes that promote equality and fairness. My education, leadership roles, and personal values have all shaped my passion for using the law as a tool to address systemic injustices and support vulnerable communities.

At Queenâs University, I excelled academically, earning numerous scholarships for my achievements in applied economics. This rigorous academic training has provided me with a strong analytical foundation, allowing me to assess complex social and economic issues critically. As President of the Queenâs Economics Society, I honed my organizational and leadership skills, overseeing various initiatives, speaker events, and networking opportunities. This experience taught me the importance of collaboration and strategic thinkingâskills that are essential when advocating for social change.

In my role as a law student at Girones Bourdon Kelly Lawyers, I gained firsthand exposure to the practical aspects of legal work, including conducting research, drafting documents, and preparing court filings. I had the privilege of assisting clients during intakes, and I saw how vital legal support is for individuals facing challenges related to housing, immigration, and poverty. These experiences reinforced my desire to pursue a career in social justice law, where I can provide legal services that address both immediate needs and systemic barriers.

Additionally, my work as a wildland firefighter in Ontario allowed me to develop resilience and teamwork skills, while my volunteer work as a hockey instructor helped me foster empathy and leadership. 

I believe that A social justice externship offers the chance to deepen my legal expertise while making a meaningful impact on issues such as racial inequality, civil rights, and economic justice. I am excited to contribute my skills and passion for justice to the broader mission of advocating for social change, and I believe this externship will provide invaluable experience in advancing the causes I care about.","I am eager to pursue an externship in private or civil law as it aligns with my academic interests, practical experiences, and long-term career goals. My rigorous academic background, hands-on legal training, and leadership roles have all prepared me for the nuanced and dynamic work involved in private practice, where legal expertise is essential in resolving complex disputes and protecting individual rights.

As a law student at Western University, I have received the Dean of Law Scholarship, an acknowledgment of my academic dedication and analytical abilities. My strong foundation in applied economics from Queenâs University, where I earned several prestigious scholarships, has allowed me to develop a keen understanding of financial and economic considerations. 

In my role at Girones Bourdon Kelly Lawyers, I have gained firsthand exposure to the world of legal practice. I conducted legal research, drafted documents, and assisted in preparing court filings. I had the opportunity to meet with clients, participate in mediation briefs, and help draft statements of claim and other legal documents. This experience gave me valuable insight into the client-driven nature of private law practice and the precision required in drafting documents that protect clientsâ interests. Working on a variety of civil and commercial matters, I developed a strong appreciation for the intricacies of legal negotiations and the role of lawyers in facilitating resolution.

My leadership role as President of the Queenâs Economics Society further strengthened my skills in negotiation, problem-solving, and communication. These skills are directly transferable to private practice, where client relationships and clear communication are key to achieving successful outcomes.

A private or civil law externship would provide the perfect environment for me to apply my academic knowledge and gain further insight into the practice of law. It will allow me to refine my skills in dispute resolution, legal writing, and client advocacy while contributing to a practice that strives to ensure fairness, clarity, and justice in everyday legal matters.",,,,,"I believe that I am an ideal candidate for a business law externship, offering a unique blend of academic strength, practical legal experience, and leadership skills. I am currently pursuing my Juris Doctor at Western University, where I am a recipient of the Dean of Law Scholarship. My undergraduate background in Applied Economics from Queenâs University, where I graduated with honours and received multiple prestigious scholarships, has provided me with a solid foundation in financial and economic analysisâskills that are directly transferable to business law.

In addition to my academic credentials, I have hands-on experience in the legal field through my role at Girones Bourdon Kelly Lawyers, where I was involved in legal research, document preparation, and client intakes. This experience has given me insight into various legal processes, which I am eager to apply in a business law setting. I also have leadership experience as the President of the Queenâs Economics Society, where I managed operations, organized events, and cultivated relationships with key stakeholdersâskills that will prove valuable in navigating the dynamic world of business law.

My background in economics and legal research has allowed me to develop a keen understanding of financial markets, risk management, and corporate governance. This combination of skills makes me well-suited to engage with the complexities of business law, where legal expertise intersects with financial and economic considerations.

Additionally, my bilingual abilities in French and English will enable me to contribute effectively to diverse business law matters. My strong analytical skills, coupled with my passion for the field, position me to make meaningful contributions to any business law externship, and I am excited about the opportunity to further develop my skills in this area.","I would like to pursue an externship in intellectual property (IP) law as it aligns with both my academic background and my growing interest in the intersection of law, innovation, and business. My studies in applied economics, combined with hands-on legal experience, have fostered a strong analytical foundation and a deep appreciation for the legal protections that help drive creativity and technological advancement.

At Queenâs University, where I earned several academic honors in economics, I developed a keen understanding of the economic principles that underpin intellectual property law. My academic success has allowed me to explore the broader implications of intellectual property rights on innovation and market competition. I am particularly interested in how IP law fosters a balance between protecting creatorsâ rights and encouraging the broader public benefit from new ideas and technologies.

In my role as a law student at Girones Bourdon Kelly Lawyers, I gained practical legal experience, assisting with legal research, document drafting, and client intakes. While the majority of my work focused on civil and corporate matters, I began to see how IP issues intersect with many areas of law, particularly in the context of business transactions and protecting proprietary assets. This experience piqued my interest in IP law and the role it plays in safeguarding the intangible assets of individuals and companies.

My leadership experience as President of the Queenâs Economics Society, where I organized networking events and speaker series, has equipped me with strong communication and organizational skillsâskills that are essential in IP law, where clear negotiation and thorough legal documentation are crucial. I am eager to apply these skills in a legal environment focused on protecting patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, and to learn from experts in the field who navigate the complex and evolving world of intellectual property.

An externship in intellectual property law will allow me to gain practical experience in a rapidly growing area of legal practice, and it will provide me with an opportunity to deepen my understanding of how legal protections can drive innovation and economic growth.

Human Rights causes have always been closely connected with my identity. I grew up witnesses the aftermath of South African Apartheid and hearing the stories of life during that era. I've also had the opportunity to watch how a country I consider a second home has emerged as a global leader and international advocate for human rights. I also have a family connection to human rights. My mother was appointed as a provincial Human Rights Commissioner in Saskatchewan. She has been an incredible inspiration to me for practically contributing to justice in her community. I would love to follow in the steps of my parents and grandparents. I feel responsible to take on their torch in the long walk to freedom",,"Growing up as a South African- Canadian, I have always had an international perspective. I would love the opportunity to learn more about international law and contribute to my community in a new capacity. ",,"My interest in labor and employment law stems from how essential it is to the lives of so many people. Growing up in Saskatchewan I remember how strikes and lock outs impacted my community and many classmates. I have a deep respect for the lawyers and arbitrators who work to mediate conflict.
While I studied accounting during my Bachelor of Commerce, I took many labor law and human resource management classes. I also have some practical exposure to different labour and employment environments around the world, notably in the South African context.
As a Muslim, I am particularly interested in exploring the legal questions surrounding workplace discrimination and employee rights. As workplaces become more diverse and inclusive, I believe that labor and employment lawyers have a crucial role to play in ensuring that all employees are treated fairly and with respect.
From a career perspective, I would love the opportunity to work in a highly impactful area. There is a lot of reliance on labour and employment lawyers as their work impacts peoples livelihoods.",,"My interest in business law stems from a combination of personal experiences, academic studies, and professional exposure. My grandfather owns a stationary shop in South Africa. I remember running around the shop growing up, and as an adult Iâve witnessed firsthand the complexities and challenges of running a business. This early exposure sparked my curiosity about the legal frameworks that govern business operations and inspired me to pursue a career in business law.

During my undergraduate studies in Accounting, I took several courses in business law and corporate governance, as part of my Bachelor of Commerce. I was particularly intrigued by the intricacies of contract law, mergers and acquisitions, and intellectual property rights. These areas of law not only align with my analytical skills but also resonate with my passion for helping businesses navigate legal challenges and achieve their goals.

My professional experiences have further solidified my interest in business law. I worked for a local corporation called iTracks, where I drafted contracts, conducted legal research into regulations and reporting requirements, and wrote internal policy. These experiences have provided me with a practical understanding of the legal issues that businesses encounter. Additionally, I have developed strong communication and negotiation skills, which are essential for a successful career in business law.

My values and principles lead me to exploring the legal questions surrounding corporate social responsibility and sustainable business practices. I believe that business lawyers have a crucial role to play in guiding companies towards ethical and sustainable practices.

In terms of career goals, I aspire to work in a law firm or as internal corporate legal counsel where I can leverage my skills and experiences to add value to businesses. I am also interested in contributing to policy development and advocacy efforts aimed at promoting fair and transparent business practices. My unique perspective, shaped by my background and experiences, allows me to approach legal issues with a holistic and empathetic mindset, making me a valuable asset in the field of business law.
","My wish to pursue intellectual property law is closely related to my response for business law. I am very comfortable in a corporate setting and have an interest in IP advisement and litigation. I love the idea of learning about new ideas and concepts within my work as a lawyer. IP lawyers have the opportunity to work in healthcare, automotive, and other STEM fields. I have always had a deep passion and curiosity for science. This led me to work for the past two years at a virtual healthcare startup in Saskatoon. I also enjoy how IP law requires creative solutions to its unique problems.

I would be very happy to have IP or business law as an externship, they are effectively tied for my first choice.

Criminal, constitutional, and administrative law are unique areas of law in that they govern the relationship between individuals and the government. Where the majority of Canadians will likely never be involved in civil litigation or complex business transactions, every Canadian is affected by public law.

There is significant overlap between public interest and social justice as areas of law. I am passionate about social justice and have always envisioned using my legal training to help others when picturing my future career. My worldview has been significantly informed by the analytical lens of intersectionality which I was first exposed to in my undergraduate studies. In fact, the unique opportunity offered by the legal profession to have a significant impact on the lives of others is the main reason I opted to pursue law instead of academia when I was considering what I wanted to do with my history degree from Carleton University.
I care deeply about social inequality and access to justice issues, which are precisely the sorts of topics I would be able to work on in a public interest legal role. During my early undergraduate years, I thought that lawyers worked on too small of a scale to have any meaningful impact insofar as social justice and public interest issues. However, the more I learned about the legal world and the more I studied historical social movements, I came to realize that practicing law and working on that small scale, individual level is the best way I can leverage my skills and abilities to have a meaningful social impact. 

It has always been my goal to put public interest at the forefront of my eventual career, and I greatly look forward to the opportunity to begin that work this upcoming summer.

It has always been my goal to put social justice at the forefront of my eventual career, and I greatly look forward to the opportunity to begin that work this upcoming summer.

I would be thrilled to work in any sort of social justice-related legal role from engaging directly with clients in a clinical setting to assisting in research about Charter rights. To any role I will bring with me my passion for social justice, knowledge of intersectionality and social issues, my academic research and writing skills, and my desire to grow as a legal thinker and future practitioner.","I have always been interested in litigation due to my passion for both public speaking and debate. I am especially fascinated by class actions and human rights litigation. Class action lawsuits offer the unique opportunity to represent a large number of people with a common grievance. Beyond obtaining justice for the group being represented, class action work can also be extremely impactful in inspiring significant shifts in policy. Human rights litigation is similarly impactful and immensely important in shaping the landscape of rights in Canada. When picturing my future legal career, I have always envisioned myself serving as an active advocate for my clients. Accordingly, civil law is closely aligned with my interests and career goals.

I am especially excited to see the Christian Legal Fellowship and Canadian Civil Liberties Association listed as organizations contained within this category. I have been interested in intervener work ever since attending AndrÃ© Schuttenâs CLS guest lecture on religious freedom that was held this past October. Constitutional law has proved to be one of my favourite first-year courses at Western Law so far. I had never pictured myself being interested in or practicing constitutional law until reading Charter cases and coming to appreciate the immense extent to which constitutional law issues impact the daily lives of Canadians. 

My desire to advocate for others in their search for justice is the prime reason I decided to pursue a career in law, and civil law is an excellent avenue through which I can achieve that goal.","As a history student at Carleton University, I spent almost the entirety of my undergraduate degree studying countries and cultures outside of Canada. Accordingly, I am very interested in both world relations and foreign legal systems.

My history background has provided me with a unique perspective on international law issues. I believe that understanding the relations between any two nations requires understanding the history underpinning those relationships. Studying history has also given me extensive experience in analyzing issues from different perspectives and worldviews. For example, it is impossible to genuinely understand something like the rise of the Soviet Union without taking the regime seriously and engaging with it on its own terms. My ability to empathize with diverse viewpoints and apply different analytical lenses to the same topic would be extremely useful in an international law position.

In attending law school, my first and foremost career goal has always been to use my legal training to assist others in navigating the system and advocating for their best interests. International law would allow me to pursue this interest in a unique and interesting way due to its wider-reaching nature. Whether dealing with transnational trade, conflict, or cooperation, international law issues can have significant implications for the populations of the nations involved. The existence of an extradition agreement between two nations, for example, can play a pivotal role in an accusedâs criminal proceedings. 

Overall, not only do I believe I possess the skills and knowledge to succeed in an international law placement, but I am also very curious about international law and would be thrilled to explore the field further.",,,"Family law is the field I am most interested in pursuing for my legal career. Women, marriage, and the family were key areas of interest for me throughout my undergraduate degree. The Married Womenâs Property Acts, fatherâs rights activism in Canada, and domestic violence in early modern England are just some examples of topics related to marriage and the family that I have completed research projects about. I am especially interested in the way power dynamics manifest within the family context, particularly in terms of domestic abuse. While much of family law revolves around finances, equally significant is the uniquely personal and emotional character of family legal disputes. Accordingly, I believe that a robust and nuanced understanding of the ways in which power can manifest in the family ought to be foundational to any informed and emphatic family law practice. 

Although family law is not available to take as a course in the first year of law school, I have sought out exposure to the field through the Western Family Law Students Association of which I am the director of communications. Through the FLSA, I have had the opportunity to chat with several practicing family lawyers which I have found endlessly fascinating and which has strengthened my interest in the field even further. 

Family law is one of, if not the most personal areas of law. As a result, the field offers a unique opportunity to have a lasting and significant positive impact on the lives of others which has always been my ultimate goal in pursuing a legal education and career. With my significant research experience, academic exposure to the subject area, and genuine passion for the subject, I feel that I am fully equipped to learn and succeed in a family law summer position.",,,127302.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_NVHf0Sbgbrolrkl,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_Oy9EwnMeJIx3ExX,"Toronto / Greater Toronto Area, London","In-Person,Hybrid",,,,,,,,,

Private/civil law has inspired me to look deeper into its constituent fields and explore issues such as corporate negligence and contract disputes. Engaging with private/civil law has also introduced me to sports law, which I am fascinated by. As someone with a passion for sports, particularly martial arts, civil liability and contract disputes in the context of sports is something I would be eager to learn more about and potentially make a career in.
	My professional experience in commercial finance law has been useful in exploring issues in contract and property law, as much of the work I did were related to issues of breach of contract and property rights over the leased equipment. My professional experience brings not only transferrable skills, but inspiration to learn more about the role of civil law in the finance industry. While I am still not fully sure of what specific kind of law I wish to make a career in, I do know that civil law will play a significant role in whatever area of law I choose to work in. I believe that I would thrive in this environment and I thank you for your consideration.
","I have a deep academic connection to international law, as I have studied international law and related subjects such as international politics, economics, and foreign policy during my undergraduate studies. As someone with a deep interest in global affairs, I have always been particularly drawn to international law and its role in global affairs and foreign policy. Much of my research experiences and skills have been gained through researching global trade, global economic development, global conflict, American foreign policy, and many others. I would like to further explore international law and its relation to other fields of law, such as international business law and international criminal law.
	My passion for international law comes from my drive to gain a better understanding of the issues that affect the world whether they relate to international trade, conflicts, and crime. My academic background in international issues not only provides me with transferable research skills and knowledge on international law, but also a unique perspective on international law that incorporates the nuances of international politics and economics. 
	The relevance of international law in other areas of law continues to grow with globalization. A greater understanding and experience in international law will enhance my understanding of other areas of law, such as business law. While I am not entirely sure yet what area of law I wish to make my career in, I know that working in international law will further my passion for International affairs and better inform my perspective on other areas of law. I believe I would be well suited for this position and am grateful for your consideration.
","Environmental law is a subject that continues to fascinate me as a field of law. During my undergraduate studies in politics, philosophy, and economics, concerns surrounding the environment were reoccurring topics in each discipline. Conversations surrounding environmental policy, environmental economics, and environmental ethics were commonplace. My academic exposure to a breadth of environmental issues sparked my interest in learning about the role of the law in environmental issues and gave me the skills to effectively conduct multi-disciplinary research on environmental issues. 
	Now that I am a student of law, my interest in environmental law has only grown. I am particularly interested in learning about the role of environmental law in corporate accountability and corporate adherence to environmental regulations. my professional experience working in commercial finance marketing and law furthered my interest in these subjects, as I was curious in how companies maintain adherence to environmental regulations. These topics particularly inspire me as they combine my interest in corporate law with my moral convictions in protecting the environment. My academic background in environmental issues spanning multiple disciplines and my professional experience in business are not only the skills and knowledge I bring, but also what inspire me to be a part of the solution.
	While I am not entirely sure what area of law I wish to make a career in, a career in environmental law is certainly a field of law I would be interested in. environmental law would allow me to explore my interest in a variety of legal subjects while having a positive effect on the world. An understanding of environmental law would also certainly be relevant to my career goals should I pursue a career in corporate law. I believe my skills and interests make me well-suited for this position and I thank you for your consideration.
",,,"My personal connection to business law and my inspiration for pursuing it as a career comes from my work experience in commercial finance and business law. In the summers during my undergraduate studies, I worked for Questor Financial Corp. in commercial finance. During my time at Questor, I learned more about the world of commercial finance through engagement with customers, vendor clients, and team members at Questor. I would later work at Bennington Financial Corp., where I would be a part of their legal department and gain hands-on experience with business law relating to commercial finance. During my time at Bennington, I gained valuable experience assisting in drafting statement of claims and gathering information for writ clearance letters. 
	My experiences at Questor and Bennington inspired my interest to study business law and to pursue it as a career. I was further inspired when learning more about corporate law while completing my Certificate in Law during my undergraduate studies. 
While my work experience is mainly in commercial finance law, I am eager to learn more about other areas of business law, such as corporate governance, securities, and mergers and acquisitions. My desire to work in business law is reflected by my unique business experience at various levels and my passion to better understand the impact of law in the world of business. I believe my passion and skills make me perfectly suited for this position and I thank you for your consideration.
","Intellectual property (IP) as an area of law has always fascinated me and has inspired me to learn more about it. I was able to learn more about IP law while completing my Certificate in Law during my undergraduate studies. Since then, I have been fascinated with the growing application of IP law and wish to further explore how IP law impacts major industries such as software and pharmaceuticals. 
	As IP law becomes more and more relevant, better understanding itâs application will help me in my legal career regardless of what field of law I choose to work in. This became especially apparent during my time working in commercial finance, as software and AI played an ever-growing role as tools for marketing. The growing presence of these tools in the modern world and IP lawâs role in the development of these tools makes IP law not only incredibly fascinating, but also crucial to understand when building a career in law.
	My experience working with AI for marketing purposes provided me with not only a unique experience with the growing field of software IP, but also an understanding of its relevance and impact across industries. I am very open to the idea of pursuing IP law as a career and am certain that I would like to learn more about it and gain hands-on experience with it.

While my primary role was to teach conversational English, our discussions often touched on their personal experiences settling in Canada. Many of my students shared stories of workplace exploitation due to their lack of awareness of their legal protections, while others were in need of immigration counsel and unable to access it due to financial barriers. This experience highlighted the gap in accessible resources and instilled in me a passion for promoting equitable access to justice and legal aid, regardless of socioeconomic status. 

My undergraduate background in life sciences has further deepened my understanding of how the social determinants of health, including poverty, access to education, and systemic discrimination, impact individual and community well-being. This has provided me with an interdisciplinary understanding of the intersection between health and human rights, and has further strengthened my desire to effect change.

During my undergraduate degree, I gained experience as a mentor to first-year students and a supervisor at a coffee shop. When working as a supervisor, I often dealt with customers berating the service staff and I was responsible for diffusing tense situations while ensuring my staff were not disrespected. As a mentor, I supported students in navigating the challenges of transitioning to university life by fostering a sense of community. These experiences helped me to become a stronger advocate for others and taught me the importance of standing up for the rights of others.

I am interested in working in social justice and human rights law to continue my path of advocacy and to help advance my career interests in this field.
",,"I am interested in working in international law this summer because of my desire to explore how the law can address complex global issues. While my academic background in science has primarily equipped me with scientific research skills, my current legal studies have sparked my interest in the broader scope and impact of law. I am intrigued by lawâs impact on multiple areas, including human rights and international trade.

Although I havenât had direct experience working in international law yet, I am interested in pursuing a career in this field due to my interest in global issues. I am ager to work in the field of international law during my 1L summer to gain hands-on experience in this field.","I have always been passionate about climate change and the environment, making me interested in pursuing a career in environmental law. My academic background in life sciences has provided me with a solid foundation to understand ecological issues, which will equip me with the ability to approach environmental law with scientific insight and my legal knowledge. Specifically, a class on drug and environmental toxicology taught me the impact of chemicals, pollutants, and toxins on ecosystems and human health.

Environmental law is of interest to me because it highlights an intersection of science, policy, and law, offering me an opportunity to use both the knowledge gained during my undergraduate degree and my law degree. I am particularly interested in corporate environmental responsibility, as I worked at a coffee-shop during my undergraduate degree where our mission statement was sustainability. We demonstrated our commitment to sustainability through compostable cups, straws, and utensils alongside working to reduce our carbon footprint. I am also interested in delving further into regulation and policy.

My goal is to use my legal career to advocate for policies that protect the environment, and I am eager to work in the field of environmental law during my 1L summer to gain hands-on experience in the field.",,,"My desire to work in business law stems from my experience working as a supervisor at a student-run coffee shop during my undergraduate degree. As part of the management team, I gained firsthand insight into the challenges of running a small business, including navigating intellectual property disputes, drafting employment agreements, and addressing confidentiality concerns. These experiences opened my eyes to the legal struggles that many small businesses face and the difficulties they encounter without proper legal aid.

Working closely with a diverse team in a fast-paced environment also deepened my appreciation for effective communication and negotiation skills, especially when addressing workplace conflict. On multiple occasions, I was tasked with leading discipline meetings for staff. These meetings required me to address performance issues constructively, ensure that shift expectations and consequences were clearly communicated, and foster an environment where staff felt both respected and motivated to improve their performance. This experience is conducive to a career in business law because it honed my ability to navigate workplace issues and balance competing interestsâ skills which I believe are essential when advising businesses on employment law and conflict resolution.

I am eager to work in this field during the summer after 1L to gain further hands-on experience and provide me with the experience to have a successful career in business law.","Throughout my undergraduate degree in Life Sciences, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of technological innovations and protection of these innovations through law. Gaining hands-on experience researching the immune response to the COVID-19 vaccines expanded my appreciation for the impact of novel scientific innovations and highlighted the importance of IP law evolving with technology. My classes, covering topics ranging from CRISPR, to pharmaceutical patents, to new genetic engineering opened my eyes to the intersection of intellectual property law and science. I am fascinated by how IP law cultivates innovation through providing a framework which supports creativity and research while balancing the need for accessibility and public benefit.

In the Certificate in Law program at Queenâs University, I took a course on IP, through which I learned the legal basis of patents, trademarks, copyright, and licensing. In this course, I completed assignments drafting NDAs, patent applications, and licensing agreements. This taught me not only the technical basis of IP law, but provided me with hands-on experience in the field. My interest in IP law was solidified in my property law class in 1L, where we discussed case law on the aforementioned areas. Delving into case law stressed to me the importance of improving access to IP legal aid, as many innovators may be unaware of the protections offered to them by the law. IP law offers me a unique opportunity to use my scientific knowledge gained from my undergraduate degree to help advance my legal career.

I am eager to work in IP law to help eliminate barriers to protecting IP rights while gaining hands-on experience in the field.",143301.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_A50eJZEdhZWczf3,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_1rBwCgh0KWARlsm,Toronto and/or London,"In-Person,Remote,Hybrid",,,,,,,,,

What is not lost on me however, is that this is not necessarily the norm for many others.  I have never taken this for granted and instead, have used the resources available to me to not only become better versed in the barriers and obstacles faced by many marginalized and underprivileged groups but to find ways to assist in improving, to the extent possible, their current plight.

Nowhere was this more evident than my work in the summer of 2023 with the âJays Care Foundationâ. I was a program leader at the RBI Summer Edition Program leading activities for newly arrived immigrant children who were not fluent in English and whose families faced economic and cultural barriers that made life in Canada intimidating and isolating. It was rewarding for me to witness the children slowly experience feelings of belonging in a country that was foreign and unknown to them. 

My experience with the foundation in the summer before applying to law school helped reinforce my commitment to making meaningful change as a lawyer and advocate. It continues to inform my passion for social justice and has motivated me to build on my experiences and use law as a tool to drive meaningful change. 

The opportunity to work with an organization focused on social justice and human rights is incredibly compelling to me, as it would allow me to explore these issues in the context of the legal field, while also providing me with the ability to apply my skills in research and advocacy to support individuals and communities facing barriers to justice.",,"The field of international law is of great interest to me as I have always had a curiosity for exploring global legal challenges and seeing how legal systems operate across borders. I am particularly interested in learning about the tension between respecting the sovereignty of states while also enforcing accountability among nations to uphold global standards and protect human rights.

My passion for learning about international law is inspired by my exchange semester abroad in Ireland, where I gained a deep appreciation for how interconnected the legal system and our world really is. One of the highlights of my semester aboard was a course I took that studied criminal behaviour and its social environments. The course content touched upon the vastly different social environments in different parts of the world, and how these local environments create differing views about justice, equality, and human rights. 

My work with the Jays Care Foundation the following summer further reinforced my interest in exploring international law. In my role, I led activities for newly arrived immigrant children who were not fluent in English and whose families faced economic and cultural barriers that made life in Canada intimidating and isolating.  I was able to witness firsthand how challenging it can be for immigrants to adapt to life in a new country. This experience emphasized the critical role that international law plays in ensuring the rights and dignity of immigrants and refugees, and establishing legal frameworks that provide resources, opportunities, and support systems for these members of the population. 

Overall, international law is a field I am interested in exploring in depth. It offers me a unique opportunity to learn about and understand complex global challenges related to human rights, immigration, and the protection of the environment. ",,"My interest in labour and employment law is informed by a course I took in my undergraduate business degree at the Schulich School of Business. At Schulich, I had the opportunity to take a course that studied employees and their workplace environments, as well as how these environments can influence individual employee success and organizational outcomes. The course emphasized the critical role that workplace dynamics such as inclusivity, fairness, and safety play in fostering employee well-being and productivity. It also provided valuable insights into the legal and ethical frameworks that underpin effective workplace policies.  This course made clear to me that labour and employment law can be used as a means to advocate for fairness and equity in the workforce. It also helped me recognize how critical equity in the workplace is in achieving broader societal outcomes. Strong and equitable workplace environments can help reduce economic inequality and foster inclusion in our society. 

Along with my passion for advocating for an equitable and inclusive workforce, I believe my experience with the Western Law Sport Solution Clinic has equipped me with valuable skills that I can transfer to a role focused on labour and employment law. During my first semester with the clinic, I conducted in-depth legal research on complex issues related to athlete disputes with their National Sport Organizations. This involved analyzing relevant statutes and policies set out by the athletesâ organization. This experience would translate well to labour and employment law, where advocating for fair treatment requires understanding and applying a variety of laws and policies to address issues in the workplace. My work with the clinic also allowed me to communicate legal concepts in a clear and concise manner to athletes who had little knowledge or understanding of the law. This is an essential skill when advocating for workers or employers who face complex legal issues.",,"As an undergraduate business major with a specialization in accounting, I have always had a passion for learning about how the world of business interacts with law. I learned in my studies that legal frameworks play a role in every facet of business, from compliance with the Income Tax Act to regulations on product and manufacturing standards, as well as protections for contractual corporate relationships. The critical role business law plays in our society inspires me to explore it in more depth and better understand how businesses and corporations navigate often complex regulatory frameworks. I believe my experiences throughout my undergraduate studies has fostered a foundational understanding of business law, as well as a curiosity to explore in greater depth the legal frameworks that regulate the business landscape. 

As a graduate of the Schulich School of Business enrolled in the accounting program, I had the opportunity to build a foundational framework in the field of business. I completed many courses in various disciplines, ranging from tax accounting and financial statement analysis to sustainable business practices and family enterprise management. While at Schulich, I developed strong financial literacy skills, gaining a deep understanding of budgeting, financial analysis, investment strategies, and the principles of sound financial decision-making. 

I also developed strong research and written communication capabilities during my undergraduate program, where I served as the Vice President of Content for the Insider Media Group. My work as VP of Content entailed being the âvoice of the Schulich community,â requiring me to research, write, and edit engaging articles, newsletters, and magazines covering topics and issues relevant to my school community, such as the rise of corporate journalism in the digital age, and an interview with the Founder and CEO of a top startup at York University.

Overall, my interest in the field of business law, my educational background, and my professional and extracurricular experiences make me confident that I not only would want to explore the field in greater depth, but that I have the necessary skills to succeed in a summer position with an organization focused on business law.
","Intellectual property law plays a critical role in fostering innovation, creativity, and economic growth in our society. It is a multifaceted industry where business, science, technology, and culture are interconnected. I would like to work in an organization that focuses on intellectual property because it would provide me with a unique opportunity to learn about a variety of industries such as science, business, entertainment, and technology, while also allowing me to explore how legal protections for intellectual property help drive innovation and safeguard creators. 

I was introduced to intellectual property during my undergraduate studies at the Schulich School of Business, where I took a Business Law course that explored the role that patents, copyrights and trademarks play in our rapidly evolving economy. My initial exposure to intellectual property law helped deepen my understanding of the role it serves in safeguarding competitive advantages and promoting innovation and technological development.  
 
My work with the Insider Media Group, a student run publication at the Schulich School of Business, allowed me to explore innovation and intellectual property protection in depth. In my role as the Vice President of Content, I was required to produce magazines, articles, and newsletters that explored emerging trends in the digital age and how copyright law factors into content creation and media ownership. I was also able to expand on this experience in my role with the Western Journal of Legal Studies in my first semester at Western Law. My work with the journal this semester has not only allowed me to hone my attention to detail and written communication skills but has also reinforced my passion for exploring different areas of law. The opportunity to delve into and analyze diverse legal scholarship has broadened my perspective and deepened my understanding of the dynamic and evolving nature of the legal field. This experience demonstrates my ability to engage critically with complex legal issues and support initiatives that advance knowledge and innovation in the legal field.

An externship in which I practice employment and/or labour law would be a great learning experience.
My interest in employment law comes from my work experience. For two consecutive summers I worked as a summer student at the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB). In my role I was primarily responsible for onboarding newly registered employers and educating them about organization policies. I made hundreds of calls to employers. When confronted with policy questions I quickly and efficiently searched policy documents to provide informed answers. I work well with employers and I am familiar with many of the problems they face, especially those pertaining to the WSIB.
Furthermore, Prior to the WSIB I worked in various manual labour and leadership positions that gave me direct exposure to industries often subject to employment and labour disputes. Industries like roofing, construction, landscaping, tree planting, and maintenance at a summer camp. Each position taught me different lessons and developed different skills, yet they all had one thing in common: they brought forth my positive attitude and strong work ethic. I believe there is much values to being able to empathize with both sides of a given dispute and I believe my work experience has set me up well to understand issues that both employers and employees face.",,"I am pursuing a career in litigation. Business law experience, be it transactional or advocacy, is highly valuable experience to a student like myself who is interested in litigating commercial or corporate disputes. Hence I am interested in a business law externship this summer.
For two consecutive summers I worked as a summer student at the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB). In my role I was primarily responsible for onboarding newly registered employers and educating them about organization policies. Doing so I interacted with employers from a variety of industries and became interested in the work they do. This prompted my interest in business law. 
Prior to the WSIB I worked in various manual labour and leadership positions where I worked directly with small business owners. I distinctly remember driving to a worksite with a boss of mine and discussing his future plans for his commercial storage unit company. We discussed managing contracts to ensure there was always the correct amount of work, creating effective teams, and balancing work on the ground with desk work as a manager in construction. While working with corporations is quite different than small business owners, they share a fundamental concern for maximizing a company's potential.

My volunteer work with McGill Studentsâ Nightline, a confidential support service, provided me with first hand insight into the challenges faced by individuals that may not be visible on the outside. This reinforced my dedication in taking an empathic approach and focusing on advocacy.

Furthermore, my background in sociology has given me a deep understanding of how social structures perpetuate inequality. This perspective allows me to approach legal issues with a wider, more comprehensive view, knowing that there are always multiple factors at play, and the actions of individuals is just one aspect of this. I am personally interested in exploring how legal systems systematically disadvantage certain groups while being more lenient to others. I am interested in the many factors that go into this and investigating ways to change this pattern to ensure that the legal system does achieve justice in a more equitable way.

Through my many summers working as a camp counsellor and later as an assistant camp director, I have developed an immense appreciation for working directly with people. I have also learned how to vary my approach in communicating with others depending on what they need, instilling in me a dynamic and adaptable attitude. 

I believe that my work and volunteer experience coupled with my academic background and interest make me well-suited for this field. 
",,"My interest in international law was sparked during my study abroad experience at University College London. During this time, I was exposed to a diverse academic community and explored different perspectives on sociological and environmental issues. Through this experience and the courses I took, my awareness of the unique role and challenges of international law expanded. I realized how interconnected our world truly is and how impactful international law can be in addressing global issues.

International law appeals to me due to its ability to address many critical matters such as human rights, trade, climate change, and conflict resolution. I am particularly interested in how international legal institutions can bring countries together to tackle these complex challenges. However, it is evident that although these institutions have ambitious and important goals, they are often hindered by individual countries' shifting political climates or a lack of incentives to comply with international legislation. To me, this is what makes international law both challenging and fascinating, as it is not as straightforward as national legal systems and involves intricate issues of sovereignty, jurisdiction, and enforcement.

Moreover, I believe my undergraduate studies in sociology provide me with a unique perspective on how cultural, political, and economic differences shape international relations. Understanding these differences is essential in navigating the complexities of international law and developing solutions that respect diverse viewpoints while promoting global cooperation.
","My passion for environmental law stems from my academic background in environmental science and my professional experiences with nature-focused organizations. As Assistant Camp Director at The Riverwood Conservancy, I designed and led programs aimed at fostering environmental awareness among children, helping them connect to nature and understand the importance of preserving ecosystems. These experiences reinforced my belief that when individuals have a personal connection to the environment, they are more likely to take action to protect it. I am inspired by the idea that everyone has a role to play in making positive environmental change.

While earning my undergraduate degree in environmental sciences at McGill University, I learned about the significant impact that large corporations and governments have on the environment. The scale and power of these actors make tackling environmental issues a challenge. However, my studies also showed me the importance of legal frameworks in addressing these problems. Through the dedication of many organizations and individuals, there is hope that we can move towards positive environmental change. I believe the law can be a powerful tool in protecting our natural world, ensuring that harmful practices are mitigated and sustainable actions are prioritized.

Another key aspect of environmental law that fascinates me is its international dimension. Many environmental issues, such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution, transcend national borders, making international collaboration essential. The legal frameworks needed to address these issues require coordination between countries with different laws and priorities. This complex challenge presents an opportunity to shape international policies that can have a lasting impact. I am particularly interested in the role law has to play in fostering the international cooperation needed to protect our planet.

In pursuing a career in environmental law, I aim to combine my academic background, hands-on experience, and passion for the environment in hopes of creating a more sustainable future for years to come.
",,,"My interest in business law stems from a deep curiosity about the complex legal frameworks that govern commerce and entrepreneurship. As Social Media Manager for The Bull & Bear, a student-run magazine at McGill University focused on business, culture, and the arts, I was introduced to the expansive world of branding, marketing, and digital strategy. This experience sparked my passion for understanding the legal mechanisms that support and protect business operations. My growing interest in business law was further reinforced during my first semester at law school, where I developed a keen interest in contract law and its crucial role in shaping business transactions.

Throughout my summers as a Camp Counsellor and later as Assistant Camp Director, I gained valuable experience in communication and relationship-buildingâskills that are equally vital in business law. In both roles, I learned the importance of adapting my communication style to effectively address different individuals and situations, whether mediating disputes or managing teams. This ability to understand the needs of others and tailor my approach will be instrumental when navigating client relationships in a legal context.

In business law, the ability to communicate clearly and resolve conflicts is essential, whether negotiating contracts, advising clients, or managing legal challenges. My experiences have shown me that fostering strong interpersonal relationships and ensuring that all parties feel heard and respected are crucial for success in both leadership roles and legal practice. These skills, combined with my academic and professional experiences, have motivated me to pursue a career in business law, where I hope to help businesses thrive while ensuring legal compliance and ethical practices.
","My fascination with intellectual property (IP) law originates from my creative and professional experiences in content development and digital media. As Social Media Manager for The Bull & Bear, I collaborated on original content, oversaw the creation of media pieces, and observed the nuances of copyright and content ownership. This experience ignited my interest in how legal protections foster innovation and creativity. I am particularly drawn to questions about how IP laws evolve in the ever-growing digital age, addressing challenges such as copyright infringement, patent disputes, and trademark protection.

During my undergraduate studies in environmental science, I also learned about some drawbacks in relation to how IP law can be utilized to take advantage of certain communities. In particular, I studied the patenting of traditional Indigenous medicines by large companies for profit, thereby excluding these communities from their own discoveries. These issues of equity, and balancing innovations and discoveries with public access to knowledge for societal benefit, are intellectual challenges that interest me greatly. Additionally, I am very intrigued by the intersection of IP law and healthcare and its relation to bioethics. The complex issues and ethical questions that arise in this field affect all of us to some degree and require a nuanced and thoughtful approach.

These experiences have deepened my desire to explore how IP law can be used as a tool for fostering both innovation and fairness, ensuring that advancements benefit society while respecting the rights and contributions of all communities. I am committed to engaging with these critical issues and contributing to the development of equitable and forward-thinking legal frameworks that promote both progress and justice.

While I grew up, I watched close family members navigate an extremely challenging emotional battle, including divorce and a custody battle. This experience resonated in me the vital role of legal advocacy in resolving conflicts and protecting the best interests of children.

I am intrigued by how family law often interacts with broader social issues like domestic violence and mental health. Additionally, I am also eager to explore how our constantly evolving society plays a role in family law, pertaining to such as changing definitions of family, the impact on legal systems and potential new policies.

I am commited to advocating for fairness and support for children during some of the most vulnerable moments in their lives. This field provides the opportunity to not only resolve disputes but to create outcomes that foster healing and positive change within families.

Although still early in my legal career, I hope to have a job where I can combine legal expertise with compassion to support individuals and families. Whether through mediation, litigation, or policy advocacy, my goal is to create solutions that promote stability and well-being.

I was responsible for overseeing the safe and efficient movement of over 30 boats and vessels maneuvering throughout the marina, while effectively communicating and coordinating over 20 employees. This task required clear and concise communication, but also taught me how important it was to ensure team members felt supported and empowered within their roles. As a supervisor, I routinely collaborated with colleagues to resolve unexpected challenges, ensured everyone understood their roles in a high-stakes situation, and cultivated a sense of shared accountability. My time as Marina Supervisor taught me the value of remaining calm and collected under pressure, fostering mutual respect in team settings, and enhanced my capacity for rapid and effective problem-solving.","My interest in intellectual property law began with my property law class this year, as well as my upbringing. Growing up, I was surrounded by entrepreneurs and creators, and I had the opportunity to witness how ideas can transform into impactful businesses.

Although, it is still early in my legal career, I envision a career at the intersection of technology, law, and creativity. I want to help creators protect their ideas, navigate complex workplace regulations, and resolve disputes. My goal is to ensure a just legal system, supporting both innovation and equitable access to works. 

Through my time as a research assistant, and my work as a caseworker for the Western Law Business Clinic, I have developed essential skills such as legal research, analysis, and communication. Within these opportunities, I have gotten the chance to explore issues related to copyrights, trademarks, and small businesses, and honed my ability to deal with clients professionally.",301323.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2f9ifu3huWx1SGK,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3MaO29bzWjIbWl4,"GTA, Toronto","In-Person,Remote,Hybrid",,,,,,,,,

Despite these roles being varied in their practice and goals, one thing they shared was advocacy. I found a lot of fulfillment in being able to better my community through these advocacy positions. My legal ambitions are rooted in the belief that everyone has a right to legal representation regardless of other factors (income, race, gender, ability, etc.). The law structures our society, and it should benefit everybody equally. No one is less valuable than anyone else. That is what public interest law means to me. Fixing the systems in our society that disadvantage certain people or ignore/neglect certain people is something I am deeply passionate about. I believe that access to healthcare, access to justice, education, and housing are human rights. We have a responsibility, as those with the privilege to practice law, to take care of everyone in our community. Working in the area of public interest would be an important way for me to give back and fulfill that responsibility. I feel we also cannot lose sight of the fact that each person we help in our legal career will have their own diverse stories.  To me, working in the field of public interest law is exactly what that is about. It focuses on advocating for people who cannot adequately advocate for themselves. I would be most interested in exploring the intersections of disability with any of the other broader areas of public interest (i.e., healthcare, education, housing, homelessness etc.) however, I am eager to learn about any area of public interest. I would love to work in the field of public interest as a part of my career in either advocacy or private practice. ",,,,,"My interest in labour and employment law has been growing since I was a child. My father is a very active member of his union at his workplace and has been for over 15 years. Discussions of the rights of employees, the rights of employers, and how often there are injustices faced in the workplace were commonplace throughout my childhood and even up until now. My grandfather was also a very active union member as well. My father and I still to this day continuously engage in conversations about how labour law and experience of employment could be improved. My passion is in resolving conflicts between employees and employers to facilitate more positive working environments for everyone. Everyone works at one point in their lives, and I think that it is paramount that these issues are a priority. I would love to practice in the labour and employment field, and I am particularly interested in labour bargaining and arbitration. I would also love to explore the intersection of disability and employment law. My passions for my career are rooted in bettering my community and I think supporting positive labour relations is an amazing way to do so. I believe everyone is entitled to accessing employment and having their rights respected in the workplace. I also have many years of experience working at a unionized grocery store that gives me a practical look into labour relations. Learning how to navigate a collective agreement, advocating for my rights in the workplace (as well as encouraging others to advocate for theirs), and seeing firsthand the issues that emerge in a workplace between employees and employers are directly useful in addressing the issues raised in labour law. I have also worked temporarily as a department manager and have been acting store manager on various occasions, which has allowed me to see various perspectives within the dynamics of employment. Both my personal and professionals goals and interests directly overlap in the field of labour and employment law. I would love to use my skills and practical experience in the labour field to make a positive difference.","I have had the opportunity over the last few months to be an associate caseworker at Westernâs Community Legal Services (CLS). CLS is operated by the Faculty of Law and funded by Legal Aid Ontario. It provides free legal services to low-income people in the London community. I have had the opportunity to assist on a couple family law cases throughout my time there. Through that I have gained the experiences of attending family court, preparing for a settlement conference and navigating working with clients who are experiencing a vast array of emotions due to the deeply personal nature of family law. My interest in family law is rather new, I did not have much of an understanding or curiosity before my experience at CLS. Now I am very much interested in learning more about family law after seeing how impactful the work that is done in family law is to the people seeking legal help. This is not just a legal issue to them; it is deeply emotional to face these issues, and it requires that you have a lot of compassion and understanding while navigating these complex issues. My broad career aspiration is to better my community and support the people in my community who need it the most. I feel like family law is particularly a legal field that gives you the opportunity to connect with people and provide them the compassion and support they need in a hard time. During my undergraduate degree, I was a part of the student council as a charity advocate for both the school and broader community, a club president, a peer mentor, and a student ambassador. Despite these roles being varied in their practice and goals, I took away two things that will help me in the area of family law: first, compassion is an essential part of effective and strong leadership and second, every person has their own story and needs different things from you as a leader to help them succeed. Recognizing each person as an individual with a unique story will help me be able to advocate effectively for a client. I look forward to being able to learn more about practicing in family law and using my practical insights from CLS to support my future learning.

During my undergraduate studies in Environmental Studies, I examined a range of issues, including environmental racism and its impact on Indigenous communities in Canada. One pivotal research project analyzed the Boat Harbour tragedy in Nova Scotia, where industrial pollution devastated the lands and waters of the Pictou Landing First Nation, highlighting the intersection of human rights and environmental justice. 

Through this research, I developed an understanding of how historical injustices shape modern systemic inequities. I analyzed how legal frameworks have often failed to protect Indigenous communities and, in some instances, facilitated harm. These injustices emphasized the critical need for legal advocacy that prioritizes equity and accountability, particularly in balancing environmental stewardship with the rights of Indigenous peoples. 

Beyond environmental racism, my studies expanded to migration and displacement issues. In courses like Demography and Migration, I examined systemic barriers faced by refugees and migrants, including exploitation in Canadaâs Temporary Foreign Workers Program. My qualitative research on the lived experiences of international students navigating Canadaâs immigration system further reinforced the importance of human-centred approaches to legal and policy frameworks. 

My commitment to social justice extends beyond academics. As a captain of a Motionball fundraiser team for the Special Olympics, I led efforts that raised over $1,100, contributing to a broader school initiative that raised nearly $23,000. This experience taught me the power of community collaboration and deepened my resolve to support marginalized groups through both advocacy and action. 

These experiences have shaped my passion for addressing systemic barriers and ensuring access to justice for marginalized communities. The intersection of environmental challenges, human rights, and the legal system inspires my commitment to crafting legal solutions that emphasize equity, inclusion, and accountability. 

Looking ahead, I aspire to contribute to advocacy and policy-making that address these intersecting challenges, whether through litigation, systemic reform, or community engagement. My academic foundation in environmental and social justice, combined with my dedication to centering lived experiences in legal solutions, positions me to make meaningful contributions to social justice and human rights law.",,"My interest in international law emerged during my undergraduate studies in Environmental Studies, where I examined how legal frameworks address global challenges such as transboundary pollution and resource management. Analyzing cases of international cooperation to resolve transnational issues deepened my appreciation for the role of law in promoting sustainability and equity, inspiring my commitment to a legal career focused on addressing complex global challenges. 

My academic and professional journey has prepared me to approach global challenges with a legal lens. At SMU, I developed strong research and analytical skills, particularly in studying governance mechanisms for environmental challenges. Law school has further honed these abilities, with coursework like Legal Research and Writing refining my capacity to conduct in-depth legal analysis and communicate complex ideas effectively. 

My interests extend to migration and corporate accountability, areas intrinsically linked to global governance. In Demography and Migration, I explored systemic barriers faced by displaced populations and the legal frameworks shaping their lives. In Ethical Responsibilities of Organizations, I analyzed corporate responses to environmental violations, uncovering gaps in governance and opportunities for reform. These experiences reinforced my understanding of the interconnected nature of global challenges and the pivotal role of legal advocacy in addressing them. 

Beyond academics, I have pursued opportunities to foster dialogue and collaboration. As Vice President of the SMU Geography Society, I led initiatives like the Environmental Gala, uniting diverse stakeholders to address sustainability and policy issues. These experiences honed my ability to engage across disciplines and cultivate practical solutions to complex problems.

My role as a legal intern at Metro Law Office LLP was instrumental in grounding my understanding of legal processes, particularly in the context of business operations. This role involved extensive administrative responsibilities, preparing legal documentation, and attending mediationsâexperiences that equipped me with a fundamental understanding of the intricacies involved in business law. These tasks required meticulous attention to detail and an ability to manage complex information, skills which are directly applicable to the challenges faced in business law.
Additionally, my academic endeavours, particularly through the Undergraduate Summer Research Internship Program at Western University, showcased my ability for deep analytical thinking. My research on systemic solutions to societal problems, such as the prolonged effects of charity on homelessness, reflects my ability to approach business challenges with a critical, solution-oriented mindset. This research experience has honed my problem-solving skills, essential for addressing the diverse legal needs of startups and entrepreneurs.
Furthermore, my leadership roles, such as serving as Vice President of the Palestinian Cultural Club and Senior Editor of The Social Contract journal, have cultivated my skills in organization, advocacy, and project management. These experiences have prepared me to handle the multifaceted responsibilities in a business law setting, where precision and accountability are paramount.
During my 1L year, I participated in the Toryâs LLP Negotiation Competition, where my partner and I secured second place and earned the privilege to advance to the finals in the Canadian National Negotiation Competition. This experience honed my critical thinking and oral advocacy skills and immersed me in the dynamics of business law, with a particular focus on mergers. Working under pressure, I thrived in the fast-paced environment, which was instrumental in enhancing my ability to manage time effectively and negotiate under tight deadlines. These experiences have equipped me with a robust foundation in negotiation and a deeper understanding of the legal nuances involved in business law, which I am eager to bring to this externship position. 
I am drawn to business law because of its impact on entrepreneurship and economic development. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a practical setting, contributing to the legal frameworks that support business innovation. The opportunity to engage with experienced attorneys and handle real-world legal scenarios in your externship program is one I value highly for my professional growth.","My interest in intellectual property (IP) law is rooted in my academic background and personal experiences as a Palestinian Muslim woman and a second-generation Canadian from a low-income family. These facets of my identity have exposed me to the powerful role that IP can play in protecting and fostering innovation within diverse communities.
At Western University, I pursued a double major in Political Science and Criminology, where I developed a keen interest in the legal frameworks that support or hinder social and technological progress. My engagement as a Senior Editor of The Social Contract, analyzing various policy impacts, and my research during the Undergraduate Summer Research Internship, critiquing the efficacy of social interventions, have equipped me with critical analytical skills that are essential for the nuanced field of IP law.
My professional tenure as a legal secretary/intern at Metro Law Office LLP provided me firsthand exposure to the meticulous nature of legal documentation and reinforced my interest in the detailed-oriented nature of IP law. This role underscored the importance of precise communication and thorough legal understanding, skills that are fundamental in IP law practice.
Furthermore, my leadership roles in the Palestinian Cultural Club and the Arab Studentsâ Association at Western University have honed my abilities to manage, protect, and promote cultural and intellectual assets. These experiences have given me a practical understanding of how intellectual property can be used to safeguard cultural heritage and intellectual contributions, aligning closely with the principles of IP law.
My personal and academic journey has instilled a deep appreciation for the mechanisms that protect innovations and creative works, making intellectual property law a natural fit for my skills and aspirations. I am motivated by the potential to use IP law to empower underrepresented communities by ensuring their innovations and traditional knowledge are recognized and protected legally.
I am eager to delve deeper into intellectual property law through your externship program, to better understand and contribute to the development of laws that foster innovation and protect creators, particularly from marginalized communities.",283076.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2VgPUgkkb45ni3U,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_PAPSDSfBR6OU88x,"London, Ontario","In-Person,Hybrid",,,,,,,,,

Through my SA1L externship experience, I would like exposure to public interest causes related to health so that I might learn more about the intersections between law and our healthcare system. I first became interested in health law after taking bioethics courses during my undergraduate degree. In the first bioethics course I took, I was introduced to the concept of capacity and became curious about informed consent in the healthcare setting. Next, I took an advanced bioethics course, which investigated the intersections between bioethics and disability studies. I learned about the unique bioethical issues that impact people with disabilities. During my undergraduate education, I also took a course called Indigenous Health which exposed me to the unique health disparities Indigenous Peoples living in Canada face. To further my study of bioethics, I wrote my undergraduate thesis about a bioethical issueâinformed consent in cross-cultural health research. Now I am curious to learn more about capacity and consent in the healthcare setting. I am also interested in serving marginalized communities who have been continually underserved and oppressed by the Canadian healthcare system, such as Indigenous Peoples and people with disabilities. I would appreciate the opportunity to work on a project or conduct research related to these interests. 
In addition to my interest and previous experience investigating bioethics and health law issues, my research and writing skills make me an excellent candidate to assist in any public interest project. I developed strong research and writing skills while completing my aforementioned undergraduate thesis. I learned to accurately summarize concepts I researched and to synthesize new ideas and solutions from the literature on a topic. I also have excellent communication and organizational skills. For example, I am currently a vice president of communications for the Western Health Law Association. I collaborate with my co-VP to communicate with our members about the WHLA initiatives and events, and I help manage the WHLAâs social media profiles.","I would be well-suited to working on a social justice and human rights law project as social justice is important to me and aligns with my values and personal politics. Indigenous rights are a particular area of social justice I am passionate about and would like to learn more about. During my undergraduate education, I took two courses that exposed me to the historical and continued oppression of Indigenous Peoples in settler Canada. In the course Contemporary Indigenous Studies, I learned about the Indian Act, police violence against Indigenous people, the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in Canadian carceral facilities, and how climate change disproportionately affects Indigenous Peoples living up north. In a course called Indigenous Health, I learned about the lasting trauma impacting residential school Survivors and their families, the historic oppression of Indigenous people at the hands of doctors, the continued discrimination Indigenous patients face, and the health and nutrition issues that disproportionately impact Indigenous Peoples. These classes not only taught me about the oppression of Indigenous Peoples, but I also learned how to better listen so I can understand the experiences of marginalized communities. Through better listening and understanding, I can better ally myself with them and advocate for them. I would appreciate the experience of working on a project advancing Indigenous rights should the opportunity exist. 
In addition to my intermediate knowledge about the historical and continued oppression Indigenous Peoples face, I have experience discussing, researching and writing about a variety of social justice issues. My undergraduate program, the Arts and Science program at McMaster, has social justice built into the core of the program.
My research and writing skills while completing my undergraduate thesis also make me an excellent candidate to work on any social justice law project. My thesis was about improving the informed consent process in cross-cultural health research to ensure the process was more culturally competent. I learned to accurately summarize concepts I researched and to synthesize new ideas and solutions from the literature on a topic.
",,,,"My LRWA assignments have sparked my interest in employment law. My small group class is contracts and my small group professor is very knowledgeable about employment law; thus, our LRWA assignments have each been about an employment contract issue. Through working on these assignments, I have learned a lot about both contracts and employment law. I have enjoyed learning about the unique problems that can arise related to employment contracts, given the power imbalance inherent in employment relationships. Through working on these assignments and learning from them, I have had the opportunity to reflect on my own employment experiences. I now feel better prepared to advocate for myself in the workplace using my newfound knowledge and I recognize that this knowledge is a powerful tool. I would enjoy working on projects to protect employees who are not knowledgeable about their rights and help them recover what they are entitled to.

","I am interested in family law-related SA1L placement because I am curious about a potential career in family law. I would appreciate working in a SA1L position connected to family law so that I might further explore my interest in this area of practice. Through exposure to family law issues and work, I hope to determine if I have a passion for family law and am well-suited to it. One aspect of the practice of family law that I am drawn to is negotiation. I became interested in negotiation when preparing for and then competing in this fallâs Torys negotiation competition. I make use of my new negotiation skills frequently, and I am a stronger and more persuasive communicator because I participated in the competition and practiced negotiation skills. I would like to witness others put negotiation skills to practice in family law cases. I would also learn more about how family law disputes can be settled with less combative methods to arrive at more mutually beneficial decisions.

I enjoyed applying the statutory rules to hypothetical pieces of intellectual property to determine how they could be protected and in what way. I would enjoy making similar judgements and predicting how a court would analyze a piece of intellectual in a potential SA1L position. The intellectual property unit of my property law course I also appreciated my professorâs discussion of the ethics of intellectual property protection and the benefits and drawbacks of allowing a few to benefit financially from their creations. One topic in intellectual property law I am curious about is pharmaceutical patents and evergreening. One day I would like to learn more about how patents can effectively be extended through small changes and the ethics of allowing such patents to be approved.

Volunteering with CLS has made me more aware of the importance of providing legal resources and services for people who otherwise would not be able to access them. This has increased my interest in social justice and human rights law. After graduation, I wish to use my legal education to increase access to justice. A placement with a Social Justice and Human Rights Law organization would help me to pursue this goal by enabling me to gain experience in an area of law that aims to increase access to justice. 

The summer before entering law school, I worked as a Charity Analyst for Charity Intelligence. In this position, I assessed charitiesâ financial information and reported results. I summarized this information in reports posted on Charity Intelligenceâs website to help guide the giving decisions of Canadians donors. This position greatly improved my research and writing skills, as I learned to condense information from Charitiesâ websites and reports into summaries that conveyed information to Canadian donors comprehensively and avoided the use of complex sector-specific jargon. I also gained experience in conflict management through meetings with the management teams of charities who had questions about their assessments. These research, writing, and conflict management skills would assist me in tasks for a Social Justice and Human Rights Law organization.

Working for Charity Intelligence also increased my interest in the not for profit sector. I would be curious to explore how the legal profession intersects with the not for profit sector through a placement with a Social Justice and Human Rights Law organization.

As a Charity Analyst, I conducted research on a variety of non-profit organizations, including some private/civil law organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union. This allowed me to learn more about the work conducted by private/civil law organizations. 

I am also very interested in constitutional law, and would be interested in exploring legal work in this field. Private/civil law organizations that work to protect constitutional rights align with my academic interests, and I would appreciate the opportunity to learn about the application of constitutional law outside the classroom through a summer placement.

Volunteering with CLS has made me more aware of the importance of providing legal resources and services for individuals who otherwise would not be able to access them. It has also increased my understanding of inequalities within the legal system, and the importance of ensuring that weaker parties have the power to hold more powerful parties accountable. Working with an international law organization would allow me to participate in work that levels the legal playing field on a much larger scale by addressing the power imbalance between communities and exploitative corporations.

While interning at Groia & Company, I shadowed a senior lawyer in a Small Claims Court case. I witnessed the advocacy process firsthand, from preparing arguments to addressing nuanced legal questions. This fascinated me by how the law resolves disputes and restores balance in interpersonal and business relationships. This experience sparked my curiosity about private lawâs role in safeguarding rights and fostering fair outcomes.

Building on that introduction to the private law realm, my entrepreneurial experience with FireConcerts has also provided me with firsthand insight into how private disputes arise and the importance of resolving them effectively. As the co-founder of a popular social media page that collaborated with record labels and artists, I navigated issues involving contractual obligations, partnership disagreements, and intellectual property rights. These experiences highlighted the complexities of managing business relationships and the critical role of private law in settling disputes, ensuring fairness, and maintaining trust between parties. I was involved in many deals and contracts and had I ever been taken advantage of; I would have relied on private law remedies to protect my interests and seek fair resolution. 

My undergraduate background in economics has provided me with the ability to approach complex legal issues. Through my studies, I developed strong analytical and research skills and learned to think critically and evaluate complex economic systems. These skills are directly transferable to the legal realm and coupled with my attention to detail and creative mind, give me a unique perspective to understand and develop solutions to intricate private disputes.

As an entrepreneur, I am drawn to private law because I have witnessed firsthand the need for equitable resolutions to business disputes. Equitable resolutions are fundamental because they ensure social stability and confidence in legally binding agreements. This experience will provide me with a strong foundation to pursue a career in private practice and help clients navigate legal challenges to achieve fair outcomes.","My academic background in economics deepened my understanding of the global systems that underpin international transactions. Analyzing market dynamics, trade policies, and financial systems during my undergraduate studies at Queenâs University cultivated my curiosity about how international law governs competing interests between nations, corporations, and individuals. I am particularly fascinated by the creation of trade and defense treaties. The interplay between economic incentives and geopolitical considerations drives my curiosity to explore how a nation can maximize what lies in its national interest.

The way legal principles adapt to the complexities of global commerce and cross-border disputes has motivated me to explore international law as a field of study and practice. Accordingly, I joined the Canada-U.S Law Journal in September as an Associate Editor. This journal provides students, faculty, and professionals the opportunity to explore cutting-edge issues in regulatory divergence between Canada and the USA. With the incoming Trump administration and Canadaâs political uncertainty, understanding and navigating these issues are more important than ever.

During my undergraduate degree at Queenâs University, I was a finance executive on the Queenâs Student Diversity Project (QSDP). The main goals of QSDP were to promote a safe and equitable space on Queenâs campus for individuals of all backgrounds. International law aligns with my values of equity and global collaboration as it offers the opportunity to address pressing legal questions on a global scale that promotes equity and safe spaces for all.
Through this externship, I hope to deepen my understanding of international legal systems and gain practical insights into the mechanisms that govern global relations. This opportunity will serve as a stepping stone toward my goal of pursuing a career in international law, where I aspire to advocate for the best interests of my nation.","My passion for environmental law stems from my connection to nature which has shaped my life experiences. I am a frequent visitor to Algonquin and Quetico Provincial Parks in Ontario and I have developed a profound appreciation for the beauty and fragility of nature in todayâs day and age. My awareness of the fragility of our environment has inspired me to seek ways to contribute to meaningful change. I want to ensure that the next generations of Canadians can enjoy the same experiences and nature that I have been so fortunate to experience.

During my undergraduate degree in economics at Queens University, I took and excelled in ECON 290: Environmental Economics and Assessment. This course was enlightening and introduced me to the intricate linkages between the economy and the environment. The curriculum of this course exposed me to the economic approaches to valuing nature and the complexities involved in designing effective environmental policies. We learned about how markets tend to fail to allocate environmental assets efficiently and how governmental policies can shape the use of natural resources like air and water. This has given me the important ability to understand the economic considerations behind policies involving the environment.

My career aspirations are rooted in advocacy. I have always been fascinated with high-stakes issues that intersect with economics. As such, I am driven to design effective environmental policy and work on initiatives that hold corporations and governments accountable for their environmental impact. My background in economics coupled with my passion for environmental law has given me a unique skill set that I hope to contribute to developing solutions that prioritize sustainability and justice. I am excited about the opportunity to gain practical experiences through an externship in environmental law and I look forward to collaborating with like-minded individuals who share my commitment to the environment.",,,"My passion for business law stems from my experiences as an entrepreneur. In 2017, I co-founded FireConcerts, an Instagram page dedicated to high-energy concert clips, which I grew to over 65,000 followers. FireConcerts attracted the likes of famous sports players like Super Bowl LVI finalist Joe Burrow, the current quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals. I was able to monetize FireConcerts through different revenue streams and collaborated with Warner Records Inc. and various independent artists. In managing partnership agreements and licensing agreements, I developed a firsthand understanding of the vital role business law plays in structuring relationships, fostering trust, and protecting creative and commercial interests. This exposure taught me the importance of well-drafted contracts in defining clear expectations between parties, ensuring equitable outcomes, and minimizing disputes. 

Building on this foundation, my academic background in economics further strengthened my understanding of market dynamics and the regulatory frameworks that underpin business operations. Analyzing the intersections of law and economics has fueled my curiosity about how legal systems adapt to evolving business environments and technological advancements.

Having family living on another continent on the other side of the world opens your mind to concerns bigger than simply those with regional reach.

My parents immigrated to Canada in 1998 so a lot of my perspectives and learned experiences go beyond simply just Canadaâs legal issues and Canadian law. While I can say I am gaining the relevant insights into Canadian law, I cannot say the same for international law. Thus, I am interested in learning about the complex ways that regional actors come together to make decisions on such a grand scheme and similarly how compromises are made. I also want to develop a better understanding of what international law looks like on a daily basis for the average Canadian lawyer. 

Having a better understanding of these aspects will be beneficial regardless of what area of law I choose to pursue in future. However as mentioned above, it grants me specific insights into a growing sector of law and importance especially in the face of rising conflict. It also grants me the opportunity to learn about pressing issues with an international perspective which I unfortunately have not had the opportunity to participate in throughout my undergraduate years.

Although I have not worked in the legal area specifically, I am a hard worker and have been working part time throughout the last two years. Throughout my time as Youth Climate Labâs Operations Specialist, I have learned how to prioritize and organize my time in accordance with necessity. Additionally, I have learned how to be self-guided and take initiative where there is a need presented. I feel as though these skills are highly transferrable to any potential area of law. 

Similarly, as a previous business student, I feel I have developed the adequate skills to be able to engage with high-risk topics as well as the necessary communication and professionalism required on a larger scale.","I have been involved in environmental projects dating as far back as my elementary school eco club. Most recently, since the summer of 2021 I have been involved with an organization named Youth Climate Lab. Here we focus on connecting youth across Canada to discuss fears and solutions to climate relevant stressors. Climate issues, an individualâs presence, and impact on global warming and climate change have been a present interest throughout my lifetime. As such, being able to draw on my personal connection to the environmental realm and climate action and combining it with my interest in law would be something very exciting for me. 

My curiosities surrounding environmental laws stems largely from an accountability standpoint. I want to better understand how the law assists in ensuring accountability for people and corporations in particular to their climate commitments. Additionally, it would be very interesting to learn whether environmental law has extended into international law and how that fits in to the very real yet consistently missed goals surrounding various international climate conferences.

As mentioned previously, I have worked closely with the environmental network and thus have a greater understanding of the jargon as well as the concerns and movements in the climate sphere. Working closely with well-connected peers grants me a different insight from majority of folks. Additionally, having taken several climate and landback courses allows me to have a deeper understanding and appreciation for issues including indigenous environmental concerns and the potential legal problems associated with the movement. 

Having the opportunity to work with Youth Climate Lab has also granted me unique skills of independence and the capacity to self-guide, time management, written advocacy, research skills, and communication and presentation literacy. Overall combining my interest in the climate sphere as well as my various work experiences could grant me a very interesting perspective moving forward.","Throughout my time at Western University, I have seen several employee strikes including the most recent facilities management groups. While these individuals were on strike I engaged in several discussions with peers, friends, and professors to try and make sense of the situation. Ultimately, I was presented with differing views and opinions, but most were shrouded by personal bias. My interest in this area of law stems from these conversations, more specifically, what is the reality of these employment relationships and how does something like a strike affect labour and employment law. 

Additionally, I realize that working in labour and employment requires a higher level of sensitivity, especially if working with employees. I have worked in customer service and feel adequately prepared to maintain professionalism and empathy when addressing concerns. Furthermore, while working with Westernâs Community Legal Services Clinic, I have had some first-hand experience listening to clients and ensuring they feel adequately heard. I feel that both these experiences will grant me an alternative perspective when working with higher stakes and personal matters. 

Lastly, having worked part time throughout my undergraduate years and first year of law school I feel I am well equipped to handle the heavy workload associated with this sector. Additionally, working with Youth Climate Lab has also granted me unique skills of independence and the capacity to self-guide, time management, written advocacy, research skills, and communication and presentation literacy. For example, I constantly conduct research and present my analysis. Most recently I was able to assist the organization in altering their wage and benefits structure through the research I conducted on similar company structures and benefits offered with my recommendations. Being able to draw on these skills may help me be a meaningful member of the team. ",,"Having completed my undergraduate degree at Ivey Business school, I feel those years have adequately prepared me to have a dual understanding of both the business and now the legal side of a transaction. I feel this additional knowledge in areas of risk management, financial analysis, and overall communication and writing skills will allow me to have a better and deeper understanding of the content and the businesses I engage with.

Furthermore, I have an interest in working with an assortment of firms in varying industries so I can develop a better understanding of what the main components of each industry are. For example, I am interested in working with non-profits AND for-profit companies or startups AND well-established organizations. I feel the needs of each type of business differ greatly and this is an excellent opportunity for me to work with an industry or sector I may have not considered before. This will also allow me to develop transferable techniques or insights I may have not otherwise attained.

Additionally, it is my goal to work in the corporate sector so I can best utilize my knowledge. I have a great deal of interest in mergers and acquisitions as well as other aspects of business law I have had the opportunity to learn about such as intellectual property, contracts, and tax law following several courses I have taken thus far. I want to gain a better understanding of each and their practical application.

Beyond having a business degree, I feel as though my work experiences have prepared me to take on greater workloads â having worked throughout both my undergrad and current law school experiences. Additionally, working with YCL has granted me the unique skills of independence and the capacity to self-guide, time management, written advocacy, research skills, and communication and presentation literacy. For example, I constantly conduct research and present my analysis. Most recently I was able to assist the organization in altering their wage and benefits structure through the research I conducted on similar company structures and benefits offered with my recommendations. Being able to draw on these skills may help me be a meaningful member of the team.","This past semester I had the opportunity to learn a little about intellectual property with Professor Philip King as most first year law students do in their property class. I was very interested in a lot of the discussions surrounding what should be considered property and thus protected by intellectual property. I would love the opportunity to gain some more first-hand experience in the sector and see the process from start to finish. 

I am interested in pursuing a career centred on corporate or business law. Although I know this is my goal, I am uncertain about the particular aspect of business law I am ultimately interested in practicing. I understand intellectual property forms a large fraction of business law transactions and as such I would love to take any opportunity to work within any of the aspects of business law to determine if it is something I can contribute meaningfully to. 

Having worked part time throughout my undergrad and first year of law school I feel I am well equipped to handle the heavy workload associated with the business sector.

Lastly, I completed four years of my undergraduate degree at Ivey Business school. I feel those years have adequately prepared me to have a dual understanding of both the business and now the legal side of a transaction. I feel this additional knowledge in areas of risk management, financial analysis, and overall communication and writing skills will allow me to have a better and deeper understanding of the content and the businesses I engage with.",184534.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_VVhcqATXNV69Kh3,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_31RCFMnJ5thSrQr,,,,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0

Coming from a degree in politics and international relations, it naturally flows that public interest has been a primary area of study and concern I have and would like to continue to pursue. Throughout my studies, I was exposed to a variety of public interest concerns both in Canada and abroad which sparked my interest in involving myself in public interest concerned fields. Accordingly, in 2022, I was involved in the creation of London Votes; a community initiative to increase voter engagement and the accessibility of information concerning the London, Ontario municipal election. The three Co-Founders and I advocated for and created a social media presence to disseminate key campaign information to the public. The directive for this organization was to empower the London community with the critical information that would allow the public to weigh in for their own interest. I have always loved my city and the people within it and this project solidified my passion for public interest work. From this experience I developed a strong foundation of organizational, advocacy, and communication skills which I would like to continue to develop through experience in the public interest sector. This area of law is interesting, always developing, and aligns with my goals of improving societal outcomes for all.",,,"My academic focus on international relations in my undergraduate degree has inevitably led my interest to be sparked by the lawâs intersection with that field. This interest in international law has been cultivated through my academic studies and practical experiences, both in research and extracurricular activities. First, my time as a Research Associate in the Informal International Relations Lab, supporting the work of Dr. Thomas Tieku, allowed me to delve deeper into this interest while being introduced to the rigorous nature of academia. In this position, I collaborated with a team of other undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students to produce and synthesize research while managing their citations for academic publications. From this research experience in informal international relations, I have become equipped with the ability to analyze intricate concepts, synthesize information, and present it clearly; all skills that I am eager to apply in the context of international law. As well, I have gained a unique perspective from my experiential learning trip to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in May of 2024. This trip focused on international organizations and their tangible impact on laws and societal outcomes across the African continent. Visiting the African Union, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, and various other organizations in Ethiopia offered me firsthand insights into the challenges and opportunities for international legal frameworks to address issues such as human rights, global governance, development, and climate change. Through further legal education and experience, I hope to be able to engage with the evolving nature of international legal practice and contribute meaningfully to addressing the critical issues facing the world today.","Climate change and sustainability are among the most pressing issues facing the global community today. This was highlighted throughout my undergraduate studies in politics and international relations, which allowed me to explore the different dimensions of this challenge. Gaining experience in the field of environmental law would allow me to build upon this foundation in a legal context, exploring the opportunity to engage with different legal and policy frameworks formulated to address the goals, interests, and concerns that arise from climate change and the environment more broadly. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I was able to delve into some of the diverse facets of these challenges, examining how international treaties, national policies, non-governmental organizations, and legal mechanisms can and have been used to mitigate environmental harm. As well, as a Research Associate in the Informal International Relations Lab, supervised by Dr. Thomas Tieku, I was able to hone my research, analytical, and writing skills which would allow me to best support interdisciplinary and evolving legal work such as that of environmental law. While I have already explored several intersections of environmental law, such as climate change, sustainability, and conservation, I am eager to expand my knowledge in areas such as natural resource collection and mining. Pursuing work experience in environmental law would allow me to apply these academic insights in a practical setting, engaging directly with the legal mechanisms necessary to address these challenges. Working in the area of environmental law would not only be professionally rewarding but personally fulfilling, as it aligns with the responsibility I feel that we, as a generation, have in safeguarding the planet. For these reasons, I would be eager to contribute to the ever-evolving development of the practice of environmental law.",,,,"I am deeply interested in the opportunity to explore the nexus between the law and modern innovation. As a first year student at Western Law I am interested in exposing myself to a wide variety of legal areas, including intellectual property law. I am especially intrigued by the challenges that arise in the pursuit of protecting intellectual property in an increasingly digital world. As well, I would like to explore the impact artificial intelligence and its innovation continue to have in this evolving field of law. Thus far, my legal education has provided me with a solid foundation in legal principles and analysis, which I am eager to apply in a real world setting. My employment experience in academia and information services has allowed me to hone my skills in collaboration, research navigation, and organization. One experience where I have attained considerable expertise in research and analysis was as a Research Associate at the Informal International Relations Lab. In that role, the research team and I prepared and synthesized research and citations to be used in academic publications. At Western Libraries, I have become adept at navigating digital academic catalogues and databases, refining my ability to connect patrons with the material best suited to their query. In this role I was originally exposed to the impacts of intellectual property law on educational institutions by the consideration of copyright limits, sparking my initial interest in this field. I would like to continue to develop these research and analysis skills through hands-on experience in the legal field of intellectual property.

My undergraduate studies in Political Science and History reinforced my understanding of how institutional mechanisms perpetuate injustice. I learned how ecological destruction has disproportionately impacted marginalized communities, particularly Indigenous populations having a unique connection to their environment. As a member of the Assyrian community, an underrepresented and widely displaced indigenous group from northern Iraq, I understand how the erosion of a communityâs ties to its land can threaten cultural heritage and collective identity. This perspective motivates my recognition of the importance of environmental law as a means to protect ecosystems and the communities deeply intertwined with them.

At Western Law, I have developed practical skills that align with this goal. As a Student Volunteer with Pro Bono Students Canada, I am tasked with authoring a plain-language manual to help seniors navigate legal and social entitlements, refining my ability to conduct legal research and communicate complex concepts to underrepresented communities in an accessible manner. My role as 1L Representative for the Technology Law Club has further strengthened my organizational and leadership skills while exploring the intersections of law, technology, and policy relevant to protecting traditional knowledge and innovations. 

Professionally, I worked as a Personal Banking Associate at TD Bank during my undergraduate studies, where I advised clients on tailored financial strategies and guided them through complex processes on an appointment basis. I was required to maintain my own client files, keeping a close record of each unique financial situation to propose informed solutions. I also served as the branch Diversity and Inclusion Ambassador where I coordinated with other representatives to develop initiatives that promote diversity and foster an inclusive environment within the branch. These experiences developed strong communication, leadership, organizational, and advisory skills within a professional setting, and have allowed me to engage in efforts to empower individuals from diverse backgrounds. 

These experiences in advocacy, research, and collaboration have prepared me to tackle complex environmental legal challenges and develop equitable solutions that protect communities and ecosystems.","My interest in labor and employment law is tied to my undergraduate studies, where I majored in Political Science and minored in History. Through courses that examined systemic power dynamics and labour relations, I learned about the broader institutional factors that shape inequities within employment relationships. This sparked a desire to learn more about how equitable treatment and labour protections can be upheld in the workplace. Starting law school has reinforced this effort, inciting a pursuit of opportunities that deepen my understanding of how legal advocacy specifically safeguards workers rights.

These experiences developed relevant communication, leadership, organizational, and advisory skills, and allowed engagement in efforts to enforce equitable treatment within an employment context. I aim to leverage the skills gained from these experiences to pursue efforts that deepen my understanding of how to support workers through labour and employment law.","My interest in family law is tied to my undergraduate studies in Political Science and History. Through courses that examined power dynamics, social justice, and gender equality, I developed an interest in how family law can address issues related to child welfare and domestic violence. I have been particularly interested in learning how gender issues shape legal responses in a family law context, building on insights gained from courses like âMothering and Motherhoodâ that examined the challenges faced by caregivers. These experiences have shaped my effort to learn more about family law and the various protections it provides to vulnerable individuals.

My academic background, professional experiences, and leadership roles have equipped me with the skills and drive necessary to thrive in the dynamic field of business law.

In my final year of undergraduate studies, I served as a teaching assistant for three marketing courses. This role significantly enhanced my communication skills as I engaged with a diverse student body, empathizing with their unique situations and tailoring my support to meet individual needs. Positioned as an intermediary between students and faculty, I prioritized transparent communication. This experience reinforced my commitment to advocacy and the importance of clear communicationâqualities essential when interacting with and advocating for clients in a legal setting.

During my time at Tribeca Group Inc., I thrived in a fast-paced, high-pressure environment. As the Project and Marketing Coordinator, I managed upwards of 20 client orders while coordinating logistics with external vendors. This honed my multitasking, problem-solving, and project management skills, enabling me to deliver high-quality results under tight deadlines. These skills will be vital as I start my career in business law.

While at Tribeca, the company encountered a legal issue requiring immediate attention. This experience exposed me to the critical role of legal considerations in business operations and deepened my understanding of how businesses must address legal challenges proactively. Observing the intersection of legal strategy and business goals solidified my interest in business law.

Beyond my academic and professional experiences, my lifelong involvement in sports has shaped my leadership and teamwork skills. Serving as captain on various basketball teams has taught me resilience, strategic thinking, and adaptabilityâessential skills for success in the legal field. Together with my strong business acumen, these experiences provide a solid foundation for a career in business law. I am excited to embark on this path and contribute to shaping business practices through a legal lens.","My name is Paige Soberano, and my interest in intellectual property law stems from my academic background in business, as well as my professional and extracurricular experiences. As a consulting intern at Clarity & Co., I conducted market research and developed strategic plans for a client in the tech sanitization sector. To support the brand's growth and development objectives, I explored how intellectual property protections could safeguard their innovative technology and ensure a competitive edge in the market.

This initial exposure to the intersection of business and intellectual property law sparked my interest in understanding how legal protections foster creativity and innovation. To deepen my knowledge, I took two business law courses that covered topics ranging from trademarking and copyright protection to technology-focused areas such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. These courses underscored the critical role of IP law in enabling businesses to thrive in dynamic and competitive industries while protecting their proprietary technologies and ideas.

Now at Western Law, I serve as the logistics coordinator for the Western Technology Law Club. Our club highlights the intersection between corporate law and technology law, with a significant focus on intellectual property. At a recent panel event, I had the privilege of hearing from practicing IP lawyers, who emphasized the importance of IP law in helping businesses protect their innovations, establish brand identity, and maintain market advantages. Their insights reinforced my understanding of IP law as a cornerstone for safeguarding proprietary assets, ensuring fair competition, and fostering economic growth.

I am particularly intrigued by the increasing challenges posed by advancements in technology in the legal field. Specifically, balancing intellectual property protections while fostering collaboration and innovation. As industries continue to innovate, I am interested to see how the legal landscape will adapt to provide robust protections without disabling progress.

Throughout my leadership roles, including organizing Schulichâs Orientation Week and later as an Orientation Director for the York Orientation Directorsâ Association (YODA), Iâve seen the profound impact that well-structured programs can have in supporting vulnerable individuals and fostering inclusive communities. These experiences have driven my desire to use legal frameworks to promote social welfare and protect individuals. 

While my long-term career goals are centered on business and private practice, I am deeply motivated to apply the lessons from public interest work to my future legal career. I believe there is a lot to learn from organizations that do public interest work by protecting vulnerable individuals and communities. The ability to navigate complex issues, build relationships with stakeholders, and advocate for justice is equally important in the business world, where understanding social responsibility and legal ethics plays a key role in long-term success. 

In addition, my experience in leadership and strategic planning, honed through organizing events and collaborating with diverse groups, directly translates to my ability to manage complex client matters, work with different stakeholders, and negotiate favorable outcomes. These experiences will be instrumental in my ability to contribute to policy development, advocacy, and legal representation, and I am eager to apply these skills in my future legal career, where I can balance interests with a sense of ethical responsibility. ","Growing up in a diverse community in Toronto and experiencing firsthand the challenges faced by marginalized groups has shaped my commitment to social justice and human rights. My passion for this area of law is deeply rooted in my belief that everyone deserves access to justice, regardless of their background or circumstances. As someone who hails from a South Asian country where I am part of a religious minority, I have seen firsthand the challenges faced by communities in need of greater protection and recognition of their human rights. The lack of progress in human rights within my home country drives me to advocate for those who are often unheard or overlooked.  

Throughout my academic career, Iâve been drawn to issues involving systemic inequality, particularly the legal barriers faced by underserved communities. My passion for social justice was nurtured in high school, where I volunteered at a local soup kitchen and initiated the Shoebox Project at my school. These experiences taught me the importance of supporting individuals in need and addressing social issues through direct action. Volunteering at the soup kitchen gave me an understanding of the challenges faced by those who are marginalized, while the Shoebox Project allowed me to provide for those who are often overlooked by society. These formative experiences inspired my desire to use law as a tool for addressing systemic injustice. 

My interest in social justice deepened further as I led Schulichâs Orientation Week, where I focused on creating an inclusive environment for students from all walks of life. This role reinforced my belief in the importance of accessibility and equity in all aspects of leadership, and I applied these values to ensure that everyone felt welcomed and supported. My background in problem-solving, advocacy, and leadership equips me to engage in public policy development, litigation, and legal research to influence social change. I am committed to always contributing to human rights and social justice law, even if my future career leads me towards private practice.  ",,"My interest in international law actually began with space law, an area I hadnât initially considered to be part of the field. Space law fascinates me because it is constantly evolvingânew research, technological advancements, and emerging issues in space exploration create an ever-changing legal landscape. I find it exciting that the law must adapt to these advancements and new international agreements, and it made me realize how dynamic and forward-looking international law can be. This curiosity about space law opened my eyes to the broader scope of international law, which addresses pressing global issues such as human rights, environmental protection, and conflict resolution. 

What particularly draws me to international law is its capacity to shape global justice and uphold fundamental rights across borders. International law plays a vital role in balancing the needs of different nations while striving for fairness and cooperation. It provides a framework for addressing challenges like human rights abuses, environmental degradation, and international disputes, which aligns with my passion for social justice and my desire to create meaningful change.  

My leadership experience with Schulichâs and York Universityâs Orientation Weeks, where I fostered an inclusive environment for hundreds of students from diverse backgrounds, gave me insight into the importance of cross-cultural collaboration. Iâve learned how to navigate complex, multi-stakeholder situations, as well as how to negotiate and mediate between different parties with varying interests. Additionally, my role as VP of Events on various student organizations (including the Western International Law Association), organizing international exchanges and collaborations, sharpened my ability to think strategically and coordinate with different groups to achieve common goals. These experiences have equipped me with skills in problem-solving, communication, and empathy that I see as essential for tackling global challenges. 

Iâm particularly interested in using my skills in legal research and diplomacy to contribute to international legal solutions, especially in areas related to human rights, global accountability, and corporate responsibility as well.  ",,,,"My interest in business law was sparked during my undergraduate studies at the Schulich School of Business, where I specialized in finance and earned a certificate in International Management. It was here that I developed a deep understanding of corporate governance, international business, and the complex legal frameworks that apply to global issues. I was particularly drawn to how laws regulate corporate actions, whether in the context of mergers, acquisitions, or compliance with regulatory standards. This curiosity grew during my two summer internships at Scotiabank, where I worked on streamlining internal reporting processes and made recommendations to senior management that were eventually implemented. The hands-on experience allowed me to see how internal structures and corporate decisions intersect, further deepening my interest in business law.  

What excites me most about business law is its influence on everyday life. As a former business student, I found that every aspect of my studiesâwhether marketing and copyright law, accounting and tax regulations, or economics and international tradeâwas deeply intertwined with legal principles. This interconnectedness is what makes business law so intellectually stimulating for me. The field is constantly evolving, driven by technological advancements and shifting policies, and I thrive in environments where change is a constant. Iâm eager to work in this fast-paced landscape, where each day presents new challenges and opportunities. With my academic background and hands-on experience in corporate settings, Iâm particularly drawn to areas like corporate governance and international transactions, where legal frameworks shape business operations.  

Beyond academics, my leadership roles, including coordinating Orientation Weeks at both Schulich and York University as a whole, serving as VP of Events in various student organizations, and studying abroad, have honed my problem-solving, strategic thinking, and collaboration skills. These experiences have equipped me with the ability to navigate complex situations and lead teams effectivelyâskills Iâm excited to apply in the field of business law. ","My interest in intellectual property law was first sparked when I learned about someone I knew who worked in entertainment law, specifically dealing with artist contracts. Hearing about how she helped protect artistsâ intellectual propertyâensuring their music, art, and creative works were legally protectedâpiqued my curiosity. This initial exposure led me to explore the broader field of intellectual property, from patents and copyrights to trademarks, and how IP law helps secure the rights of creators and businesses. 

As I delved deeper into IP law, particularly during my time at the Schulich School of Business, I found it fascinating how it intersects with business strategies, from protecting brand identities to navigating complex international trade and licensing agreements. My business background, especially in international management and finance, gave me a unique perspective on the importance of IP in both the creative and corporate sectors. For instance, in my business studies, I learned how companies leverage IP assets in negotiations, mergers, and acquisitions.  

While Iâm not looking to specialize in IP law long-term, it is an area that continually fascinates me because of its dynamic nature and its relevance in both global markets and local businesses. My experience leading Schulichâs Orientation Week and as VP of Events for various student organizations further honed my ability to think strategically, manage complex tasks, and collaborate with diverse stakeholders. I believe these skills are essential in IP law, where the legal aspects of protecting creative works and innovations often require careful negotiation and strategic decision-making. 

Overall, while my focus is on business law and private practice, I find intellectual property law to be an incredibly intriguing area, one that aligns with my background and interests, and I look forward to exploring it further as part of my broader legal career.

Growing up in a low income household, with a single mother and disabled brother, the notions of advocacy and reform have always been a core and unwavering element of my identity. I know what it means to come from an underserved community. I have seen first hand what it is like to live paycheck to paycheck, struggling without child support because you do not have the resources or the understanding on how to seek it out via litigation. I have seen what it is like to experience a room full of school board representatives dismiss concerns regarding the education of your special needs child. I have seen the realities of abusive relationships and divorce, and the strain these events take physically, mentally, and financially on all those involved. Whether experienced first hand or indirectly, these experiences have instilled in me a drive to help others in similar positions of vulnerability get the aid and advocacy they deserve.
For instance, in high school I co-organized a protest related to proposed education funding cuts. Throughout my undergraduate degree I extensively studied the impact of law and the justice system of marginalized communities, and am passionate about advocating for systemic reform in this respect. I have done research in relation to sexual and gender based violence that has made me similarly passionate about justice reform, as well as improved access to community resources. 
Ultimately, it is my goal to continue gaining meaningful and immersive work on projects dedicated to such issues and one day, to integrate these passions into my own legal career.  ","Social justice is one of my greatest passions. Since high-school, I have sought any opportunity to advocate for such issues. I've co-organized a protest pertaining to proposed education funding cuts, worked on research related to sexual and gender based violence, vastly studied the deficiencies of the justice system with respect to various minority groups throughout the duration of my undergraduate degree, and most recently, found work in a legal clinic dedicated to providing services to underserved communities. 
I fundamentally believe social justice is a core element of any functioning society, and that many of society's greatest ""problems"" can be tied to issues of inequality of access, treatment, and opportunity. As such, I am drawn to the idea of using law as a tool for social transformationâwhether it's challenging discriminatory laws, advocating for refugees and asylum seekers, or addressing issues like police brutality, labor rights, or access to healthcare. 
Ultimately, I see this kind of work as not only a legal pursuit but also a moral imperative to create a more just and equitable world. As an individual privileged enough to be in a position with knowledge and access I believe it is my duty to serve those who have not been as fortunate as myself. As such, it is my goal to continue gaining meaningful and immersive work on projects dedicated to social justice issues and one day, to integrate these passions into my own legal career.
I believe that my academic and professional experiences have allowed me to develop valuable skills in communication, legal research and writing, resourcefulness, and adaptability, that, when combined with my passion for change, makes me a uniquely qualified candidate.  ",,"Throughout my undergraduate degree I took a number of courses that introduced me briefly to the institutions and functions of international law. While I am not extraordinarily well versed in international law outside the academic context, I would love to gain hands on-experience and learn more about how much this area has to offer. Specifically, I would love to understand more deeply how international law is tied to humanitarian, social justice, and political issues, and how international law impacts domestic practices. 
Additionally, as the world becomes increasingly interconnected and interdependent I see an understanding of and experience with international law as a valuable tool to have both as a lawyer and a citizen. For instance, a number of social, economic, and political issues in Canada appear to be intimately tied to those of other nations, and to understand this more deeply will help me to be a more informed advocate and voter.
Finally, I believe my professional and academic experience has allowed me to develop a number of transferable skills, including those of verbal and written communication, research, resourcefulness, and adaptability.  ","While I am not particularly well-versed in environmental law, I am deeply passionate about environmental conservation and see environmental law as a powerful tool for making meaningful change to domestic and international practices. My interest in this field stems from a strong desire to address pressing environmental challenges, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution which pose a direct threat to the prosperity of my own and future generations. 
I am interested to learn more about how legal frameworks can hold corporations, governments, and individuals accountable for their impact on the environment, and how environmental law initiatives can influence real-world outcomes.
Environmental law offers the opportunity to make a tangible difference, and I believe my adaptability, resourcefulness, communication, and research experience give me the requisite skills to succeed in such a position.  ",,"Growing up with a single mother, I have seen first hand what it is like to live paycheck to paycheck, struggling without child support because you do not have the resources or the understanding on how to seek it out via litigation. I have too seen the realities of abusive relationships and divorce, and the strain these events take physically, mentally, and financially on all those involved. I have witnessed friends and family struggle through the difficult path of adoption with fear and uncertainty. Ultimately, these experiences have instilled in me a drive to help others in similar positions of vulnerability get the aid and advocacy they deserve.
While I have little direct experience with family law, I believe my academic and professional experiences thus far have provided me with a relatively strong foundation of transferable skills. For instance, as an undergraduate student I worked on research related to sexual and gender based violence. This role allowed me to understand and explore in detail the realities of abusive relationships and the role that the law plays in these instances. Additionally, in my fourth year of undergrad I took a class on homicide, and for the final project, prepared a presentation on domestic homicide. Again, this experience allowed me to understand the realities of abuse and the importance of legal, emotional, and community support in ensuring positive outcomes. Finally, working at Westernâs community legal services has exposed me to a number of real family law cases, and given me experience in professional collaboration and advocacy.
I believe that my strong communication skills, empathy, and commitment to justice can make a meaningful difference, and am committed to using these skills to support individuals and families through some of the most challenging and emotional times of their lives.",,,125354.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3F8vBU1MBkfqyhb,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2b0Ct9JTH2bX8yg,,,,,,,,,,,

I chose to major in sociology in my undergraduate degree in order to continue studying these issues that I am passionate about. In one of my sociology classes about Population Politics, I wrote a research paper about the contemporary reproductive control and population control of low-income women of colour in the United States which was published in the peer-reviewed, student-led journal at the Queen's University undergraduate sociology department. I took many classes about and did research on these issues of public interest that I am interested in and have continued this research personally since completing my undergraduate degree. My demonstrated passion for a wide range of issues of public interest make me a strong candidate for a position in this area. 

I have experience at organizations that address issues of public interest that I am passionate about. In 2021, I was a communications and social media volunteer at The Shift, which is a global movement to end homelessness, housing unaffordability, and evictions. I worked alongside lawyers and human rights advocates and researchers, and learned about the human right to housing framework. I learned about how housing is inextricably linked to other issues including health and education and I am curious to learn more about the intersections and connections between those issues. 

Another issue of public interest that I am passionate about and have experience in is climate change. In the third year of my undergraduate degree, I was the Director of Speakers at the Queen's Sustainability Club (QSUS) and in my fourth year, I was the Co-Chair of the club. QSUS hosts events and a conference about different issues concerning environmentalism and climate change. This experience sparked my curiosity about and interest in climate change and I have since continued exploring this interest through personal research, including documentaries and podcasts. 

My long-standing passion for and interest in issues of public interest in personal, academic, and volunteer contexts, along with my strong research, communication, critical thinking, and teamwork skills, demonstrate that I am a strong candidate for a position in an organization that addresses issues of public interest.","I have been passionate about social justice and human rights since I was young. I believe this was a result of several factors. First, I grew up in Toronto which meant I witnessed social justice and human rights issues around me often. I saw homelessness and poverty, overhead peers at school making racist comments about other students, heard countless stories of homophobia that a family member experienced, and much more. I become curious about the extent of these issues both within and beyond my community and wanted to understand their roots and why they persist. Second, I grew up in a family where we had passionate discussions about important issues every night at the dinner table. Through these discussions, and later my academics, I learned the importance of critical thinking. Lastly, I am Lebanese on my mother's side and Irish on my father's side and my ethnic background has caused me to have a unique perspective on the importance of diversity. 

My desire to pursue my passion for social justice and human rights academically started in high school, when I took an Advanced Placement Seminar class. The class was interdisciplinary in nature and allowed students to research issues of their choosing. I researched and produced research papers about wrongful conviction and recidivism, which sparked my interest in these issues. I continued my research on these issues in various classes during my undergraduate degree, but primarily in an Intersectional Social Justice Class in which I completed a research project about mass incarceration and wrongful conviction. I also did extensive research in my undergraduate degree on reproductive rights, racism, crime among youth, and gender equality. My passion for social justice and human rights deepened during my undergraduate degree as a result of immersing myself in research about issues that I'm interested in.  

I have also had opportunities to pursue my passion for social justice and human rights in employment and volunteer contexts. I volunteered and then later worked as a Research Coordinator at The Prosperity Project, which promotes gender equity and diversity in the workplace. I led the Annual Report Card on Gender Diversity and Leadership, which was one of two main research projects at the time, and supported the second research project, Canadian Household Perspectives. Working hands-on in research on a social justice issue that I'm passionate about was an invaluable experience, as I was able to translate my passion from an academic context to an employment context. 

My academic, volunteer, and employment experiences have solidified my motivation to work in social justice and human rights law. My passion for social justice and human rights, along with my research and employment experience in the field and my communication, research, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills make me a strong candidate for a position at an organization that works in social justice and human rights law.
",,"I had the opportunity to volunteer at The Shift, which is a global movement to end homelessness, housing unaffordability, and evictions. The organization uses an international human rights law framework. They conduct government initiatives, where they hold governments accountable and help them to achieve their obligation rooted in international law to uphold basic human rights. The Shift engages in justice initiatives where they advocate for those experiencing housing instability by enhancing government knowledge and accountability. They also conduct global research initiatives and various other campaigns. My role as a social media and communications volunteer at The Shift was a valuable experience as I had the opportunity to see international law in action and I became more passionate about the role and importance that international law has. 

I believe international law and human rights are deeply intertwined, which draws me to international law as I have always been passionate about human rights. My passion for human rights was sparked during my childhood, as I saw human rights issues taking place around me in Toronto. I witnessed homelessness, discrimination, poverty, and more and found myself interested in the roots of these issues and why they persist today. I translated this interest into my academics and did an extensive amount of research into human rights issues in my undergraduate degree in sociology. I wrote a research paper about the reproductive control and resulting population control of low-income women of colour in the United States which was published in the peer-reviewed, student-led journal in the Queen's Undergraduate Sociology department. I believe my passion for human rights is applicable to the international law context as many issues of international law are intertwined with human rights.  

In addition to my volunteer and academic experience, I have skills that would be valuable for the international law context. I have extensive research and written communication experience. I became interested in research and writing during an Advanced Placement Seminar class in high school, in which I researched and wrote research papers about wrongful conviction and recidivism. I continued and grew my passion for research and writing during my undergraduate degree. I have built my skills through these experiences and now have strong research and writing skills, which has continued into law school. Additionally, I take initiative, have excellent time management, and I am a quick learner. My previous experiences, transferable skills, and interest in the field make me a strong candidate for a position at an organization that works in international law.",,"I am interested in pursuing a career in labour and employment law. I worked as a court reporter and was exposed to labour and employment law in that role. This experience sparked my interest in this area of law because it seemed like it would provide an opportunity to advocate for others in a way that would make a tangible difference to such a central and crucial aspect of life. 

I have customer service and interpersonal experience that would allow me to foster relationships with clients, which I believe is central to work in all areas of law but especially labour and employment law. I worked as a server and hostess at a restaurant which allowed me to hone my customer service skills. I had difficult experiences with some unhappy customers, which pushed me out of my comfort zone as I had to address these situations head-on. Additionally, I was the first undergraduate student in the sociology department at Queen's University to work as a teaching assistant. In this role I worked alongside the other teaching assistants and the professor, planned and led tutorial sessions for two groups a week, provided additional assistance to students when needed, and graded assignments for 50 students. This role was valuable as it allowed me to hone my interpersonal and communication skills. 

As mentioned, I worked as a court reporter which meant I interacted daily with lawyers and witnesses. This was intimidating for me at first but I quickly gained confidence and pushed myself so that I became comfortable with interjecting (sparingly but when necessary) when there were issues with the audio or a party was inaudible. Through these experiences I honed my interpersonal, communication, team work, and time management skills. 

I believe these experiences and the skills I developed are transferrable to the labour and employment law context. Additionally, I have previous exposure to labour and employment law in action. I believe these factors make me a strong candidate for a role in a labour and employment law context.","Before starting law school, I worked as a court reporter and this experience sparked my interest in pursuing a career in family law. I am drawn to the advocacy that being a lawyer requires, but I am specifically drawn to the advocacy of family lawyers. Family lawyers advocate for their clients through some of the most difficult life experiences. I would like to have a career where I make a real difference in other people's lives and help them through their biggest challenges, and I believe a career in family law would allow me to do that. 

I am highly emotionally intelligent which draws me to family law and I believe makes me a strong candidate for a position at a family law organization. I am compassionate and empathetic and I have used these characteristics in a variety of roles. In my fourth year of my undergraduate degree at Queen's University, I was a teaching assistant for the first-year Introduction to Sociology class. I planned and ran a tutorial for two groups of students each week, graded assignments for 50 students, and provided additional assistance to students. Some students reached out to me after receiving feedback on an assignment to better understand the feedback I gave them and/or submit an appeal for their grade. These conversations were a valuable opportunity for me to use and hone my emotional intelligence skills, because I needed to keep in mind that first year of undergrad is a challenging time for many students and that I needed to deliver feedback and constructive criticism in a sensitive and supportive way. 

Another experience that demonstrates my emotional intelligence was the leadership roles that I held on several of my competitive hockey teams. In these roles I had to manage conflict between teammates and liaise between my teammates and coaches. This role often required difficult and emotional conversations involving interpersonal conflicts that I had to mediate. This required me to hear both sides of the conflict, facilitate productive conversation, and help reach a solution or way forward.

Private law can be implicated in countless ways in daily life as we interact with others. As my undergraduate degree was in sociology, I am familiar with the theories and concepts that explain human interactions and the operations of daily life. I believe my interest in private law coupled with my educational background would allow for me to engage in meaningful work in this area. Additionally, I value the person-centered approach of private law, whereby you are most likely advocating for a person and their interests and needs. I value this perspective as it personalizes the work, in the sense that you know who you are advocating for. For example, you can get to know your clients, know what is important to them, and what outcome they desire to achieve. I have performed customer-facing roles for the last several years (as a supervisor at East Park) and have always found the interactions with customers to be incredibly rewarding and meaningful. I am confident that I would be well-equipped for any work that requires interactions with clients, as I know how to navigate the challenges and appreciate the importance of this sort of work.

I have also found private law to be the area that I have found most interesting and engaging in my first year of law school. For example, I have genuinely enjoyed the material covered in property law, contracts, and torts and would like to expand my knowledge in these areas. I believe my interest stems from my background (as I have mentioned), as these issues can become very personalized. I will certainly be aiming towards a legal career that specializes in private law matters.","I am interested in the area of international law for its opportunities to perform work on a worldwide scale and its benefits as we continue to experience widespread globalization. As we continue to globalize, it is imperative for law to be accessible and ensure international interactions are carried out in a fair and equitable manner. Through my undergraduate degree in sociology, I have explored the vast differences that exist along national, ethnic, and cultural lines. Now being in law, I believe that upholding the law and improving access to justice in these diverse interactions may ensure equitable outcomes. Also coming from a Polish immigrant family background, I value the ability to engage in law in an international context to bridge cultural gaps. 
I am also very interested in the partners listed for international law. For example, I am interested in Mining Watch. As mining remains to be a major industry in Canada, I am aware of the potential implications that exist for the world with its continuing prominence. I would like to be able to contribute to creating policies and laws that may be able to solve some of the existing problems. Also, since mining will likely remain a prominent worldwide industry, I understand the potential for a career in this evolving field. Also, it would be incredibly rewarding to advocate and help in creating new innovations in mining in Canada.
",,"I am interested in the area of labour and employment law based on my personal upbringing with two parents who have worked in Canada for over 30 years. Through my parents, I have come to understand the importance that social assistance and benefits play in providing a living wage and helping with the expenses in life. Without these programs, they would not have been able to afford living expenses in Canada as immigrants. Now as they reach the age of retirement, they will undoubtedly rely on their pension plans for the remainder of their lives. I believe this personal experience is important as it allows me to accurately conceptualize the importance that these partners fulfill. They allow for other Canadians like my parents to live an adequate life in Canada. 
From my experiences I would be interested in working with Income Security Advocacy Centre. I share their values of respect, empathy, and inclusion. As an associate caseworker at Community Legal Services, I have had the chance to perform client-facing working which has highlighted the importance of these values. I have learned to treat clients with all clients with the utmost respect regardless of their backgrounds. I have practiced empathy in listening to each client and understanding their situation and need for help. Also, I have been able to contribute to an inclusive environment where we strive to improve access to justice. Ultimately, I believe a career in this area would allow for me to contribute meaningfully to the community and the work would be incredibly meaningful.",,,"I am interested in the area of intellectual property law for its applicability to the modern, technologically driven world we live in. With rapid developments and changes, it could be argued that intellectual property law will only continue to become more and more important in the future. I would like to pursue a legal career in intellectual property law, for its innovative nature. I believe this would keep the profession novel, challenging, and rewarding to be able to work actively in an area of law that is continuously changing. Additionally, the premise of intellectual property law as a way to offer protection to innovation is something I strongly believe in. 
Also, with the entertainment industry being such an important part of society, there will seemingly always be a demand for intellectual property law. This would help to create for a long-term career

The assignment challenged me to delve into the intricacies of employment law, particularly focusing on just cause dismissal. I found myself thoroughly engaged in analyzing the complex interplay between employer rights and employee protections. The process of reasoning through arguments, weighing evidence, and applying legal principles to real-world scenarios was intellectually stimulating and rewarding.

What fascinated me was the delicate balance that employment law seeks to maintain between protecting employees' rights and allowing employers the flexibility to manage their workforce effectively. I discovered that just cause dismissal is not a simple matter of an employer's discretion, but a carefully scrutinized legal concept requiring a proportional response to employee misconduct.

",,,"My interest in business law is rooted in my educational background at the Ivey Business School. Studying business strategy and corporate governance has given me a strong foundation in understanding the complexities of business operations and decision-making. This has inspired me to explore how legal frameworks support the success of businesses while ensuring compliance and ethical practices.

As a 1L Representative for the Western Technology Law Club and the Western Real Estate Law Association, Iâve had the opportunity to engage with specialized areas of business law, including technology and real estate transactions. These roles have expanded my perspective on how business law intersects with various industries.
My work as an Accounting Intern at CKF and my leadership as President of the Western Pre-Law Society further highlight my ability to navigate both the practical and strategic dimensions of business. At CKF, I managed daily invoicing and bookkeeping, gaining valuable insights into the financial operations that underpin business success. In the Pre-Law Society, I led a team of 25 members and 500 general members, organizing large-scale events and managing budgetsâexperiences that sharpened my organizational and problem-solving skills.

Additionally, my advocacy skills, developed as a delegate for Team Canada at the World Universities Debating Championship and a finalist in the Cherniak Cup Trial Advocacy Competition, have prepared me to analyze complex legal issues and effectively represent diverse stakeholders. Further, as a section representative for the Ivey Women in Management Club, Iâve seen firsthand the impact of female representation in corporate environments and corporate law.

I am particularly interested in areas such as corporate transactions, mergers and acquisitions, and dispute resolution. My goal is to combine my legal education with my business acumen and public speaking skills to help clients navigate legal challenges while achieving their strategic objectives.

With a unique blend of business knowledge, leadership experience, and advocacy skills, I aspire to pursue a career in business law that bridges the gap between legal frameworks and commercial success, driving value for clients and promoting sustainable growth. I would be deeply grateful for the opportunity to work within the SA1L program in corporate law.","My interest in intellectual property (IP) law stems from my educational and extracurricular pursuits. At the Ivey Business School, I gained insights into how businesses can strategically leverage intellectual property to secure competitive advantages and protect their creativity. This understanding sparked my curiosity about the legal frameworks that support technological and creative advancements while fostering collaboration and ethical practices.

As a 1L Representative for the Western Technology Law Club, I have had the opportunity to aid in student events about emerging issues at the intersection of technology and law, including intellectual property. This role has broadened my perspective on how IP law adapts to technological advancements and challenges, such as artificial intelligence. It has also strengthened my ability to communicate complex ideas and foster connections between students and professionals in this field.
My experiences as a delegate for Team Canada at the World Universities Debating Championship and a finalist in the Cherniak Cup Trial Advocacy Competition have further refined my advocacy skills and analytical thinking.

Witnessing first-hand the stigma and neglect surrounding menstrual health in our school system, I became passionate about bringing about change. By presenting quantitative and qualitative arguments, I was part of a committee that successfully secured free menstrual products in womenâs washrooms for elementary and high schools for the Greater Essex County District School Board â later followed by a provincial mandate in 2021. This experience exposed me to the power of advocacy, inspiring a present desire to engage in equity-focused academic and professional work. 

In my undergraduate studies, I explored equity issues, such as the effects of discrimination in housing markets. As a research assistant with the Department of Sociology at Western University, I completed an extensive literature review and worked with American Census Data to examine the homeownership rates of interracial couples in the United States, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature. I also co-authored a study examining the impact of subsidized housing on housing affordability for single-parent households, employing Stata and Microsoft Excel to analyze and distill 2021 Canadian Census Data.

At Western Law, I am a volunteer with Pro Bono Students Canada, working on creating a plain-language resource manual on Ontario housing law for a local nonprofit that supports youth facing housing insecurity. This initiative combines my research expertise with my passion for increasing accessibility to the law to empower vulnerable groups in my community. 

I hope to examine housing as a human rights issue further, aspiring to contribute knowledge from these experiences to advocate for reforming housing laws to eradicate systemic barriers faced by equity-deserving groups and low-income households. In short, I see an externship in social justice and human rights law as an opportunity to bridge my academic background, professional skills, and passion for social justice to effect meaningful change.",,"Growing up in Windsor with most of my family in the United States, my childhood unfolded between borders. I pursued an undergraduate degree in economics with the goal of eventually studying law: I was excited by the prospect of better understanding the interplay between economics and the legal frameworks that govern Windsorâs position as home of the busiest international crossing in North America. I find private international law particularly interesting â examining how cross-border disputes are best addressed and its implications for international business transactions. 

Exposure to my fatherâs 30-year career in mining, where he frequently traveled to mines internationally, further sparked a curiosity about how mining intersects with international law, and corresponding environmental, business and human rights dimensions, strengthening my desire to explore international law professionally. 

During my undergraduate studies, I pursued courses aligned with this interest, including
economic development, policy, and natural resource and environmental economics. I critically engaged with topics such as the environmental costs of economic growth and the disproportionate impacts of climate change on marginalized communities and developing nations. I also explored the differences in economic development between nations and the varied policy responses to corresponding challenges, deepening my understanding of how tailored approaches are required to address inequalities and work towards sustainable growth. 

As a research assistant with the Department of Sociology at Western, I contributed to two projects, focusing on the housing attainment of interracial couples in the United States and the impacts of subsidized housing by family structure in Canada. In my research, I was able to examine housing issues in two distinct jurisdictions through conducting data analysis using Stata and Microsoft Excel. I presented my findings clearly and concisely to my research supervisor and others through academic presentation â developing analytical and communication skills I believe would be useful to the legal research, advocacy, and critical analysis required to approach international legal issues. 

I see an externship in international law as an opportunity to harness my academic background in economics and research experience to work towards and advocate for the creation of innovative and practical solutions for the complex problems that transcend borders.","I was raised by a mother who encouraged us to find ways to live more sustainably. We frequented the thrift store from a young age: the majority of our clothes, furniture, glassware, etc., are pre-loved. My father was a mining engineer, which led to frequent discussions surrounding the environmental impact of salt mining, safe road levels and how the mining industry could be more sustainable.

My upbringing instilled a desire to engage in environmental stewardship and sustainability initiatives. As a Student Trustee with the Greater Essex County District School Board (GECDSB), environmental advocacy was at the forefront. I successfully presented a motion for a paperless boardroom. Previously, board members were sent hundreds of pages of printed documents in preparation for meetings, without an option to opt to receive digital copies instead. I founded and chaired an Environmental Sustainability Subcommittee, and with the help of its members, we were able to successfully advocated for this change. I also served on a single-use plastics reduction committee, contributing to GECDSBâs strategy to phase out single-use plastics. On the provincial level, I worked to recognize student excellence in environmental stewardship, co-founding and co-implementing an Environmental Stewardship Award for OSTA-AECO, the largest nonprofit student stakeholder group in Ontario. 

In the final year of my BA in economics, I took a natural resource and environmental economics course. This course enabled me to critically engage with the environmental costs of continued growth and its intergenerational and disproportionate impacts, particularly in examining the effects on marginalized communities and developing nations. This course made me curious about how I could use my academic and research background to advocate for both the efficient allocation of natural resources and better environmental regulations â ensuring continued economic development while slowing irreparable and intergenerational impacts of environmental degradation. 

I see an externship in environmental law as an opportunity to bridge these experiences and become a stronger, more knowledgeable advocate, working toward bettering environmental outcomes. In the future, I am particularly curious about pursuing a career in environmental law centred around mining as an environmental issue due to my personal connection to the mining industry. ",,"I believe an externship in family law would be an avenue to bring together my academic research, professional experiences, and personal values. During my time as a research assistant with the Department of Sociology at Western University, I analyzed complex social problems, such as housing affordability for single parents and the housing attainment of interracial couples. Last year, I researched the impacts of subsidized housing using a child centric approach: investigating how family structure influences a childâs likelihood of living in inadequate housing. This work deepened my understanding of the connection of housing stability to family structure, strengthening my resolve to work in an area of law where there is an opportunity to better family well-being. Additionally, I became curious about how evolving family structures will impact family law. In the future, I wish to explore how legal issues surrounding non-traditional families are best approached, e.g., blended families, cohabiting partners, polyamorous relationships, etc. 

Beyond academic research, I have hands-on experience supporting children and families. As a karate instructor, I taught self-defence to children from diverse backgrounds, including children with disabilities and from low-income families. I also worked in Windsor day camps, supporting children with behavioural challenges. Listening to their stories offered me insight into the interpersonal challenges faced by vulnerable families and has resulted in me considering pursuing a career in family law, to be able to provide support and offer solutions to families in crisis. These roles also fostered my skills in conflict resolution, empathy-driven problem-solving, and serving others in emotionally challenging times. 

My leadership experiences have further instilled skills that I believe would be useful for an externship in family law. As a Residence Orientation Leader and coordinator for two mentorship programs at Western, I developed a proactive and empathetic leadership style. I guided mentees through periods of uncertainty, honing my ability to provide tailored, compassionate support. I hope to bring this approach to a potential career in family law by centring solutions to the unique needs of my clients. 
","My interest in business law arises from exposure to my fatherâs career in mining. From working underground to later managing operations, I learned about the business, regulatory, and environmental aspects of the mining industry. As a high school co-op student for a labour lawyer, I was introduced to various contracts, which sparked curiosity about the legal documentation that ensures efficient transactions and operations of the mining sector and business more broadly. 

During my undergraduate studies, I explored my business interests through courses, such as advanced monetary theory, advanced macroeconomics, and natural resource and environmental economics. Through these academic pursuits, I gained a nuanced understanding of financial markets, business cycles, and their intersection with increasingly prevalent issues, such as the environmental implications of continued industrial growth. These experiences equipped me with analytical skills and knowledge that I believe will enable me to excel in an externship in business law. Additionally, I volunteered in the economics drop-in centre at Western, teaching students economic concepts, theories, and problem-solving strategies. As a sociology research assistant, I investigated the impacts of subsidized housing by family structure using  2021 Canadian Census data. In this work, I analysed complex social problems by working with quantitative data, presenting it clearly and concisely to my research supervisor and through academic presentation. 

Furthermore, my professional experience as an RBC Insurance Production Summer Student with GreenShield Canada, strengthened my ability to manage competing priorities, while delivering results in a high-stakes environment. I collaborated with internal team members and RBC to ensure accurate insurance coverage and billing for new groups: independently managing multiple group profiles at once, resolving incomplete set-ups, addressing errors and answering email inquiries. Regularly working with Microsoft Excel, I further refined my data management skills and attention for detail, which contributed to enhanced efficiency.

Studying contract law this semester has further reinforced my interest in business law. I am drawn to roles that enable me to combine my ability to distill and communicate complex concepts with my desire to be in an area of law where I can engage in meaningful client-facing interactions, building lasting and impactful relationships.",,300456.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3Oq9zVQHmUNjqFr,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2YGlxHrZPooi8zD,"London, ON or Windsor, ON ","Remote,Hybrid",,,,,,,,,

Growing up just outside of Calgary, I could see the Rocky Mountains outside my bedroom window every morning. This fostered my lifelong appreciation for the environment. In high school, my family moved to Dundas Ontario where we lived on a 10-acre farm next to the Dundas Conservation Area. I spent countless hours walking, running, and exploring the many paths and waterfalls in the conservation area. As someone who as been priviledged enough to grow up surrounded by nature, I have an immense appreciation for how it has impacted my life. This close connection to nature has profoundly shaped my belief that corporations, governments, and individuals must all play an active role in protecting and respecting the environment.

Over the years, my appreciation for nature has evolved into a commitment to advocating for its preservation. I have witnessed firsthand how the environment can be threatened by both human activity and industrial growth, and I am passionate about ensuring that sustainable practices are prioritized. Environmental law, to me, is the key to enforcing accountability for the protection of natural resources and promoting ethical approaches to business practices that donât compromise the health of the planet.

Through case-based learning and collaborative projects, Iâve honed my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, which I am eager to apply to the legal field.

In addition to my academic experiences, my professional background has further fueled my interest in business law. As a Venture Capital Analyst Intern at Esplanade Ventures, I worked directly with startup companies, conducting due diligence and analyzing the legal and financial aspects of potential investments. This role exposed me to the complex relationship between business strategy and legal compliance, where understanding contracts, intellectual property, and regulatory frameworks was essential to making sound investment decisions.

Similarly, my time as a 1L Caseworker at the Western Business Law Clinic has given me hands-on experience in providing legal services to a small business. Iâve worked on a variety of corporate law matters, including contract drafting for IP transfer and project work agreements.

This originally led to an interest in economics, the pursuit of a business degree, and competing in the International Economics Olympiad Opentrack. Now, pivoting into law school, I am still very interested in the international stage and how policies between countries apply to one another. Already, in my first semester at Western Law, I have attended various speaker workshops addressing this topic. Most recently, I was able to attend a Runnymede Society event titled âLaw on the Battlefieldâ where they discussed both military law and international law governing war. This was a very big learning experience for myself as much of my prior experience with the international scene was heavily based on theoretical economics as opposed to the real world events. I hope to be able to continue this learning and further explore international law over this upcoming summer!

While my past experience primarily lies in real estate law and business, I believe I am still a strong candidate due to my drive and willingness to grow.","My interest in environmental law first started as an interest in environmental sustainability. More specifically, I was competing in an invite-only case competition for an airline company. While I was originally intending to simply speak about green initiatives and easy and cheap ways to be perceived as the green option by customers, my research revealed the importance of actually being green and also some really cool technologies being developed to do so. Moving forward, I began creating opportunities for others to discover this as well. As a part of Western Founders Network, Western Universities largest business/technology/entrepreneurship club, I pivoted a pre-existing event âPitch the Future!â to have a focus on environmentally sustainable innovations using technology within the hospitality sector. 

In addition to this, during my time at Canadian Tire, one of the 4 lawyers I worked with had a focus on environmental law and I had many discussions with her about the necessity for more legal professionals in this sector. Specifically, many companies are unaware of how to best interpret new regulations and put into place policies. In the future, I hope to be able to do work relating to this and I believe that working in environmental law this summer would be a great way to kickstart this goal.","This semester, I decided to do as many moots as possible as a hands-on way to explore what kinds of law I may be interested in. As an Ivey HBA/JD Dual Degree candidate, I have less electives than normal students and as such, taking measures like this is increasingly more important. While I competed in 5 different moots, my favourite by far was the BLG/Cavalluzzo Labour Moot where myself and my partner placed in the top 4 union-side teams. In this moot, we presented oral arguments on the right to collective bargain and strike challenging proposed wage restraint legislation. This kickstarted my interest in labour and employment law. 

While it may appear odd that a student with a business background has an interest in labour law, I think delving into how my interest in law began is important. At the age of 13, I was challenging my school administration on their violations of regulations. While for a very small amount of money â $10 per student, I did so on the basis on my own principles (and not wanting to have to pay for a mandatory dance class). That said, I still hold these same principles which makes me very interested in exploring labour law over the upcoming summer. 

Looking at my past experiences, I also believe I am well suited for this line of work. I have demonstrated my strong resolve and ability to get work done within tight timelines through my time at both Canadian Tire, where I worked within the legal department of their REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust), and my time working for Jesmond Wong, a sole practitioner. Additionally, over the past semester, I competed in 5 different moots, which I believe demonstrates a wanting and willingness to learn. While my past experience primarily lies in real estate law and business, I believe I am still a strong candidate due to my drive and willingness to grow.",,"This semester, rather than committing to a singular clinic I decided to explore as many different kinds of law as possible. This led me to doing 5 different moots this past semester. Despite doing these moots and exploring different fields like labour law, civil litigation, and sports arbitration, my passion still lies in business. Especially as an Ivey HBA/JD Dual Degree candidate, much of my past experience aligns with business law. This reflects in the extracurriculars I am a part of, namely Western Founders Network, Western Universities largest business/technology/entrepreneurship club. Through my involvement in this, I have been able to explore many different subsegments of business such as consulting, finance, and tech startups and hope to find a career in merging this with law. This can be seen through my involvement in the Western Venture Law Society, where I am the Director of External Communications and am assisting with planning a moot this upcoming semester. That said, I hope my passion for business law can be seen through my extra-curricular activities.

Looking at my past experiences, I also believe I am well suited for this line of work. I have demonstrated my strong resolve and ability to get work done within tight timelines through my time at both Canadian Tire, where I worked within the legal department of their REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust), and my time working for Jesmond Wong, a sole practitioner.

As a first-generation Canadian and the first in my family to attend law school, I am deeply aware of how migration, globalization, and evolving international frameworks shape peopleâs lives. Witnessing my parents navigate legal systems in a new country instilled in me a strong appreciation for the role of law in facilitating opportunities and ensuring fairness across borders. This personal experience has sparked a curiosity about how legal systems interact on a global scale and how lawyers can contribute to building more just and equitable international frameworks.

During my time at the Ivey Business School, I developed a keen interest in the intersection of law and global business. This interest was reinforced during my internships at General Mills and RBC Global Asset Management, where I saw firsthand the challenges businesses face when navigating international markets and regulatory frameworks. These experiences gave me insight into the practical complexities of cross-border transactions and how international law impacts areas such as trade, intellectual property, and human rights.

Working in international law demands not only strong legal reasoning but also the ability to navigate uncertainty, manage competing priorities, and make decisions under time constraints. My experiences have honed these skills, particularly my ability to balance precision with practicality when addressing complex challenges. Additionally, I have developed a strong aptitude for collaborating with diverse teams, a key skill in work that requires bridging differences in legal systems and client needs. These capabilities would allow me to contribute meaningfully to global legal matters that require adaptability, creativity, and attention to evolving regulatory landscapes.

What excites me about international law is the opportunity to address pressing issues, such as climate change, human rights violations, and international trade disputes. I am particularly interested in how international treaties, conventions, and institutions can help hold states and corporations accountable for their actions on the global stage. Questions around sovereignty, jurisdiction, and the balance between national interests and international cooperation are areas I am eager to explore.

","My interest in environmental law is deeply rooted in my appreciation for the natural world and the recognition that environmental protection is essential for sustainable business practices and social well-being. Growing up in Canada, I spent much of my childhood outdoors, skiing, hiking, and exploring the countryâs landscapes. These experiences instilled in me a lasting connection to the environment, which continues to motivate my desire to advocate for its protection.

At Western Law, I have been exposed to foundational principles of constitutional and regulatory law that sparked my curiosity about the role of legislation in managing environmental issues. I am particularly interested in the legal frameworks governing climate change policies, conservation efforts, and sustainable resource management. Questions about how governments and businesses can balance economic development with environmental stewardship drive my interest in exploring legal strategies that achieve meaningful change while respecting the realities of commercial industries.

Professionally, my background in business has given me an understanding of how environmental considerations are increasingly influencing corporate decision-making. During my time at General Mills, I witnessed firsthand how companies are being held accountable for their environmental impact and the growing importance of sustainability within corporate governance. I want to explore how environmental law intersects with business practices, particularly in the areas of regulatory compliance and advising clients on minimizing their environmental footprint.

My goal is to pursue a legal career that allows me to contribute to shaping sustainable policies and practices, whether through advocacy, policy work, or advising private organizations. I am especially drawn to exploring legal solutions that promote environmental justice by addressing the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on marginalized communities.

Ultimately, I believe that environmental law provides an opportunity to advocate for both the planet and future generations. Through this externship, I hope to gain practical experience in addressing real-world environmental challenges, deepen my understanding of environmental regulations, and contribute meaningfully to the pursuit of sustainable legal solutions.

Labour and employment law captivates me because it combines problem-solving, strategic thinking, and relationship-building to help clients navigate one of the most essential aspects of any organizationâthe workforce. Through my internships at General Mills and RBC Global Asset Management, I gained hands-on experience in analyzing complex business problems and identifying practical solutions. I became fascinated by the legal implications of workplace policies, employee relations, and organizational decisions, and how lawyers play a critical role in managing risk, promoting compliance, and fostering healthy workplace environments.
At Western Law, I have been actively developing my legal skills through my work at the Sport Solution Clinic, where Iâve assisted clients with contract disputes, policy reviews, and conflict resolution. These experiences deepened my understanding of advocacy and client supportâboth essential in labour and employment law, where issues can significantly impact individuals' livelihoods and businesses' operations.
During my time as Director of Clubs and Conferences at the Ivey Business School, I led initiatives to engage students with industry leaders and manage complex team dynamics. This role taught me how to balance the interests of diverse stakeholdersâa crucial skill in labour and employment law, where lawyers must balance the competing priorities of employers, employees, and regulatory bodies while maintaining fairness and fostering collaboration.
I am particularly interested in exploring how organizations navigate evolving workplace laws and adapt to issues such as diversity and inclusion, remote work, and the gig economy. Iâm curious about how lawyers help businesses balance legal compliance with maintaining positive employee relations and protecting their reputations. Labour and employment law offers the perfect intersection of my interests in conflict resolution, negotiation, and policy development, and I look forward to developing the skills needed to advise clients on matters that are integral to their success.
My dual degree in business and law uniquely equips me to understand the commercial realities that employers face and the human impact of workplace decisions. I am excited about the prospect of gaining experience in this field to develop a versatile, client-focused practice that helps clients achieve both legal compliance and sustainable workplace cultures.

","My interest in intellectual property (IP) law stems from a desire to help creators and innovators protect their ideas and navigate the complex legal frameworks that govern innovation. During my undergraduate studies at the Ivey Business School, I developed a strong foundation in business strategy and innovation, which has further fueled my interest in the intersection of law and entrepreneurship. My internship at General Mills Canada gave me the opportunity to work with new product innovations, where I witnessed how intellectual property considerations can shape business decisions. These experiences have given me a practical understanding of the challenges businesses face in protecting their ideas, particularly at the early stages of product development.

What excites me most about IP law is the balance it strikes between encouraging innovation and protecting the public interest. I am eager to explore how IP law can be used to help businesses commercialize their ideas while respecting the need for fair competition and access to knowledge. The evolving nature of IP law, particularly in the context of digital transformation and emerging technologies, presents fascinating questions about how existing legal frameworks can adapt to new forms of creation and expression.

I am motivated to pursue a career where I can assist businesses, entrepreneurs, and creatives in navigating these challenges, empowering them to succeed in competitive markets. My experiences at the Sport Solution Clinic have taught me the importance of providing accessible legal support and clear advice to clients. I am eager to bring this client-centered approach to the practice of IP law, ensuring that innovators receive the protection they need to focus on what they do best â creating.

With my background in business and my passion for helping creators protect their work, I believe I can bring a practical, client-focused perspective to the practice of IP law, contributing to meaningful legal solutions that drive innovation forward.

My background and personal interests make me eager to contribute to your organization while delving into policy creation.

As the daughter of Indian immigrants, I have gone through quite a few challenges, which have altogether helped me grow, become more resilient, and use my voice to stand up for myself and those around me. This has inspired me to use my knowledge, skills and passion to make a difference in society and the lives of people who cannot stand up for themselves. I believe the legal profession is one in which there is a need for advocacy and fairness in policy creation. Throughout the world, I always hear about social issues and injustice, which pushes me to use my resources to do good. Throughout various sociology classes in my undergraduate degree, I have learned about the impact of policy creation and law on these issues and how the legal profession can be utilized to make a difference. 

Through my experience in Brampton Focus as a Senior Business Development Intern, I acted as an advocate for small businesses and promoted their work through marketing campaigns. This work culminated in an event called Peel Amplified, showcasing their work to the people of Brampton. This experience gave me insight into the struggles faced by many of these organizations.  

By leveraging my cultural insights and dedication to social justice, I aspire to advance equity, diversity and inclusion values and foster meaningful connections within the legal field.

My professional experience and personal interests make me eager to contribute to your organization. As an Ivey Business Schoolâs Honours Business Administration (HBA) and Western Lawâs Juris Doctor (JD) dual degree program student, I am interested in further exploring private disputes and combining my passions for advocacy and law.

The image I always had of a lawyer was someone working with international corporate clients. However, the more I learned about the field and got involved, I saw the everlasting influence made by working with the community. As someone who witnessed the issues in my community that came with rapid population growth, I saw potential solutions to reduce them. Becoming a lawyer to me is more than just making a change, itâs about making a change that will last forever and impact people from different backgrounds and statuses. A role in your organization would not only help me take a step towards doing so but also allow me to start giving back to the community.

I currently work as a Legal Intern at Vigneswararajah Group of Paralegals, in which I work on and manage Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) and Small Claims Court cases and disputes using databases such as CanLII. Additionally, I learned to effectively build and sustain relationships with clients in the GTA while creating notices, applications, and schedules, and attending LTB hearings. There were times in which I had to sit in on consultations with upset and frustrated clients, which also taught me how to be a compassionate problem solver. Completing these tasks has equipped me with the necessary attention to detail, communication, and collaborative skills required to succeed in the private/civil law area of law.

I am eager to bring my personal and professional experiences to your organization while expanding my skills and network. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

During one of the major projects I worked on in this role, our team conducted interviews with department heads under the CFO of an asset management firm to gain key insights on the efficiency and role clarity of the finance function. Many interviews identified interpersonal conflicts within the team, leading to communication breakdowns and unhappiness at the firm. Seeing first-hand the types of negotiations, both formal and informal, that occur in corporate environments sparked my curiosity about the role of civil law in resolving conflicts. I aim to leverage my strong analytical and negotiation skills to advocate for individuals and organizations navigating complex legal issues in private law.

My background in software engineering has given me a unique perspective on private and civil law, particularly in areas related to contracts, liability, and consumer protection in the technology sector. I am intrigued by the challenges involved in balancing competing interests and finding practical solutions within the legal framework. I am also interested in the evolving landscape of digital rights and privacy, as businesses and individuals increasingly rely on technology in their daily lives.

Through this externship, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of civil dispute resolution, contract negotiations, and the role of the legal system in protecting individual and corporate interests. I look forward to contributing my analytical skills and collaborative mindset to support clients in achieving fair and just outcomes.","Having moved through multiple schools and environments throughout my life, I have developed a global perspective that drives my interest in international law. I am fascinated by how legal systems interact across borders to address challenges that transcend national boundaries, such as trade, intellectual property protection, and digital regulation. My technical background in software engineering has exposed me to the global nature of technology and the regulatory complexities faced by companies operating in multiple jurisdictions.

During my co-op at Magna Closures, I had the opportunity to work with suppliers and stakeholders from different countries, which gave me firsthand exposure to the legal and logistical considerations of cross-border collaboration. This experience sparked my curiosity about how international agreements, trade regulations, and dispute resolution mechanisms work to facilitate global business operations.

Through this externship, I aim to explore the complexities of international law, particularly in the areas of trade, intellectual property, and technology regulation. I am eager to gain hands-on experience in navigating the legal challenges faced by businesses and individuals in a rapidly globalizing world.",,"My interest in labour and employment law stems from my experience in leadership and team-based environments, where I have witnessed the critical role that fair and transparent workplace policies play in fostering collaboration and productivity. As president of the Thaqalayn Muslim Association at Western, I have worked closely with team members to navigate interpersonal dynamics, coordinate with university administration, and ensure compliance with institutional policies.

Whether it was leading a team in developing a network analysis tool for the Western Cyber Society or coordinating strategic initiatives as president of the Thaqalayn Muslim Association, I have gained valuable insights into organizational operations, risk management, and compliance.

My exploration of business law has been further fueled by my research into how technology is shaping legal services. Observing how companies like Willful are using digital platforms to provide accessible legal solutions has inspired me to consider the intersection of law, technology, and entrepreneurship. Business law appeals to me because it offers the opportunity to work closely with entrepreneurs and organizations, helping them navigate legal complexities while fostering growth and innovation.

Through this externship, I hope to deepen my understanding of corporate transactions, regulatory compliance, and contract law. I am excited about the prospect of gaining practical exposure to the legal challenges businesses face and contributing to their strategic success.","My interest in intellectual property law emerged during my co-op at Magna Closures, where I collaborated with the legal department to analyze technical patents. Assisting in reviewing patents to determine the novelty of our teamâs innovations introduced me to the intricate relationship between technology and the law.

My name is James Krizsan, I'm currently enrolled in a dual degree program at Western, studying both an undergrad in Mechatronics Systems Engineering (of which I've completed 3 years) and Law concurrently. I've read many books and articles about all kinds of unfairness and inequalities, about all the ""ism's"" and the blatant disregard for human rights and dignity that go along with them. Nevertheless, as a straight white male, I've never experienced any discrimination, but rather grew up in a predominantly white area and community where discrimination is hardly pervasive - likely in part because it's so monotone. 

I would cherish the opportunity to use my privileged position and education to fight for those whom until now I've done nothing substantially supportive. I'm familiar with social justice issues and human rights violations in only a third person's perspective because I only learned about them from a bird's eye view. I think I would truly benefit from an experience in this field and also be a benefit to my employer and any marginalized clients I'd be working for.

My name is James Krizsan, I'm currently enrolled in a dual degree program at Western, studying both an undergrad in Mechatronics Systems Engineering (of which I've completed 3 years) and Law concurrently. I've worked several general labour jobs, and have seen a wealth of what I'm sure are violations on behalf of management which put their workers in serious risk.

Over three summers, I've worked in a tile warehouse, a rebar processing plant, and as a garbage man. None of the workers in these companies were unionized and all of them had extremely high turnover rates. Every day there's a new face that you never see again. The employees are dealt with like basic business assets and they're used and used until they can't give any more, at which point they are promptly dropped. One of my co-workers didn't have a car, had to bike to work in a thunderstorm, got injured, was late, and got laid off that same day. The inhuman usage of these people has sparked my interest in working to protect or support these kinds of labourers. 

There are two safety buttons on the side of the garbage truck that the loader must press to activate the hydraulics for the compactor at the back of the truck. These buttons are designed to prevent the loader from getting caught in or falling into the compactor, thus ensuring safety. I was introduced to these buttons and their significance during safety training on my first day, but I never actually used them. One day, the truck I was working on was deemed ""broken"" because the safety buttons actually needed to be pressed. The company sent a mechanic to ""fix"" the truck by bypassing the electrical connection between the buttons and the hydraulics. During my time there, I never wore the ""mandatory"" safety glasses, I didnât press the ""mandatory"" safety buttons, and I didn't follow the ""mandatory"" back-up procedure when the truck was reversing. And neither did anyone else. Despite these protocols being labeled ""mandatory,"" the company routinely found ways to avoid them at the prejudice of their employees, because they were too time-consuming.

I'm entirely unsure of the legality of these issues, and there is nothing in the 1L curriculum that deals with employment law, but they certainly piqued my interest in how much employers can really get away with. I'm eager to learn what can be done to protect employees, or give them the justice they deserve and would love to work in this field.

My entire goal of going to law school is to become a patent lawyer and eventually be in a position to learn about, document, and protect inventions on the cutting edge of new technology. I hope with this summer position to learn as much about the field of intellectual property as I can. The general 1st year programming dedicates only about a week of material in a single class to intellectual property which I feel is sorely lacking, and in my upper years, I plan to take as many related courses as possible. 

I have a bit of experience with intellectual property, and it's from the inventor's side. I have part ownership in a patent for a device I designed last summer, working as a design engineer for a company called Archetype Biomedical. My project was to design and build from scratch a functioning 1st-Gen prototype of a synthetic beating heart. The device is a simulator to give surgeons practice doing beating heart bypass surgery, as it mimics a very specific motion profile over the cardiac cycle of a specific artery (the LAD) which is commonly operated on in 'Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.'

The current devices on the market are both far too expensive and pneumatic, so the goal with our device was to be comparatively much cheaper and mechanical. To do so, we came up with an extremely unique and robust design which my boss decided to get patented. I was blessed with the opportunity to describe my design to our patent lawyer and got a brief glimpse of what the industry looks like.

I have long been passionate about social justice, and over time, I have come to understand how environmental challenges disproportionately affect those already facing systemic inequalityâparticularly Indigenous peoples and impoverished communities. Throughout my academic journey, I have explored the ways in which environmental issues interact with issues of social injustice. My Masterâs research focused on a theory of exploitation that captures the experiences of sweatshop workers. In this research, it became clear to me that the exploitation of people and the exploitation of the environment often go hand-in-hand. My undergraduate research on the incarceration of Indigenous people in Canada further deepened my understanding of how land rights, resource extraction, and environmental degradation intersect with broader struggles for justice and reconciliation. This focus on the intersection of social and environmental issues motivated my work as Volunteer Coordinator at Soap for Hope Canada, where I helped divert hotel waste from landfills. In this role, I was responsible for organizing efforts to repurpose soap, linens, and toiletries, turning what would have been waste into resources for marginalized communities. This experience reinforced my belief in the power of environmental solutions that not only address ecological harm but also serve social good. Furthermore, this work highlighted the need for legal frameworks that integrate environmental sustainability with support for the most vulnerable populations, ensuring that the benefits of a healthier planet are shared equitably. I am drawn to environmental law because it provides an opportunity to create policies that protect both the environment and marginalized communities. The legal recognition of Indigenous land rights, for example, is crucial not only for cultural preservation but also for safeguarding ecosystems. Similarly, addressing climate change must involve policies that mitigate its disproportionate impact on disadvantaged groups. Environmental law offers a pathway to integrate social justice into environmental protection, ensuring that no community is left behind. Ultimately, I see environmental law as a tool for systemic changeâone that advances both ecological and social justice. By advocating for policies that protect our planet and uplift marginalized communities, I hope to contribute to a future where sustainability and equality go hand in hand.","My interest in labour and employment law is rooted in a commitment to advocating for workers' rights and addressing the systemic inequalities that disproportionately affect vulnerable and marginalized groups. Throughout my life, I have seen how the legal system can either reinforce or challenge the economic and social structures that shape the workplace. This knowledge has motivated me to pursue a legal career focused on protecting workers, ensuring fair treatment, and advancing social justice in the workplace. My academic work, particularly my Master's research on exploitation, has deepened my understanding of how labour practices often exploit marginalized workers. I explored how economic systems can perpetuate exploitation where workers, often from vulnerable communities, are subjected to unsafe working conditions and unfair wages. Additionally, my undergraduate research on Indigenous incarceration rates in Canada highlighted the structural barriers that Indigenous peoples face, not just in the criminal justice system, but also in accessing employment opportunities. This knowledge has driven my passion for advocating for policies that ensure workers are treated with dignity, paid fairly, and have access to safe working environments. My role as Volunteer Coordinator at Soap for Hope Canada helped shape my understanding of labour issues. In this position, I coordinated over 100 volunteers per month and learned firsthand the importance of fair labor practices, inclusivity, and respect in the workplace. The volunteers at Soap for Hope came from a diverse range of backgrounds. Listening to peopleâs individual needs and being open to different ways of completing tasks allowed me to see the diversity of the volunteers as a strength and vastly increased production quotas. I am particularly motivated to work in labour and employment law because it offers the chance to advocate for policies that address the challenges workers face. From ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions to advocating for policies that support workers' rights in the face of automation and precarious employment, labour law allows for tangible, impactful change. With a strong foundation in ethics and social justice, I bring a unique perspective to labour and employment lawâone that is focused on upholding the rights of marginalized workers and ensuring that workplaces are fair, inclusive, and equitable.","My interest in family law is rooted in a deep commitment to supporting individuals and families through legal challenges and ensuring that the law serves as a tool for justice, dignity, and empowerment. I have always been drawn to issues that involve personal relationships, caregiving, and the protection of vulnerable individuals. Through both my academic research and my personal experiences, I have developed an understanding of how family law intersects with broader social justice issues, particularly for marginalized communities. My academic work, particularly my Master's research on exploitation, has shaped my understanding of how individuals, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, can be exploited within intimate relationships, whether through economic, emotional, or physical abuse. Additionally, my undergraduate research on Indigenous incarceration rates in Canada highlighted the ways in which systemic inequalities impact Indigenous families, from child welfare to access to justice in family law proceedings. This intersection of family law and social justice is a major driving force behind my desire to pursue a career in family law, where I can advocate for vulnerable individuals and ensure their voices are heard in legal proceedings. In my role as Volunteer Coordinator at Soap for Hope Canada, I gained valuable insight into the importance of community support systems and how access to resources can make a profound difference in individuals' lives. Many of the volunteers I worked with were seeking ways to improve their lives and families' circumstances, and I saw firsthand how legal assistance in matters like housing, child welfare, and divorce could be transformative for families. These experiences deepened my belief that family law plays a crucial role in shaping lives and offering individuals the resources and support they need to rebuild and protect their families. I am particularly motivated to work in family law because it allows me to make a difference in people's lives, particularly those who are often underserved or marginalized. Family law provides the opportunity to advocate for the well-being of children, protect individuals from abuse, and ensure that families have access to fair and equitable legal remedies. I am passionate about promoting the rights of parents, children, and caregivers, particularly those from low-income or Indigenous communities, and working to ensure that family law remains a tool for empowerment, not oppression. With a strong foundation in ethics, social justice, and advocacy, I bring perspective that is committed to ensuring that all families, regardless of background or circumstance, receive the support and protection they deserve under the law. I hope to contribute to a legal system that not only resolves disputes but also fosters healing, dignity, and respect for all families.",,,241908.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3M5p1X0vdtrt2PH,Waugh and Associates,Criminal Defence,Kendra Waugh,Criminal Defence Lawyer,Kendra@bcdefence.ca,2507138080,"I chose Waugh and Associates because I am very interested in practicing criminal law in British Columbia. I have been interested in practicing criminal defence since I first made the decision to go to law school. Furthermore, through my work at the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, I became interested in how the legal system impacts those who struggle with substance abuse. Much of the work at Waugh and Associates focuses on drug-related crimes which would allow me to learn more about how the criminal justice system and public health issues related to substance use interact. Lastly, I am from Vancouver Island and I plan to go back to British Columbia to practice law. Waugh and Associates is located on Vancouver Island, so I would be able to spend the summer with my husband and family. I chose Kendra as a supervisor/mentor because she has an impressive background in practicing criminal defense, specifically in the area of drug-related crimes. Before becoming a criminal defense lawyer, Kendra practiced as a crown prosecutor so she has a wealth of knowledge pertaining to the criminal justice system. Furthermore, Kendra is a woman in law and for this reason, I believe that she can give me specific mentorship that applies to navigating the legal field as a woman. I am truly eager to learn from Kendra. This experience would provide legal experience above and beyond the existing externship and research assistantship positions because I would be working in a law firm in an area of law that I really want to practice in. Although I am very interested in practicing criminal defense, I have never had hands-on experience in the area. This opportunity would allow me to get tangible experience in the field, allowing me to get an accurate picture of what the practice of criminal law is like. This experience would allow me to make an informed decision about whether this is the legal path I truly want to go down. From my discussions with Waugh and Associates, it seems that the majority of my responsibilities would center around legal research. This experience would align with my career aspirations and academic focuses insofar as I am very interested in practicing criminal defence. Through this experience, I hope to gain knowledge pertaining to what it is like to practice criminal defence, allowing me to gain a better understanding of what my life might look like if I decide to pursue criminal defence. Furthermore, I hope to develop my skills in legal research, specifically in the area of criminal law. My LRWA class is contracts and, although I find the topic to be valuable and interesting, it would be beneficial for me to learn more about conducting research in criminal law. This research experience would allow me to gain a deeper understanding of the area of criminal law. I expect my work will contribute to the organization by taking some of the research work off the plate of the associates, allowing them to focus on other duties. Waugh and Associates is a small firm with a lot of work. Due to their size, Waugh and Associates does not have a lot of support staff for their lawyers, so my work could help reduce the workload of some of the associates. This work would contribute to the community insofar as those who are charged with crimes are members of the community. By helping those charged with crimes get a fair defence, I would be helping uphold justice in the community. I reached out to Waugh and Associates in November to inquire about the potential of 1L summer work. I heard back from them right before winter break and met with one of their associates (Megan Winkel) last week. In our meeting, Megan relayed that Kendra is interested in taking me on as a student, but the opportunity is largely contingent upon funding. More specifically, Waugh and Associates is likely unable to pay me âout of their own pocketâ for my work. Though I have not received a formal offer, I have the impression that if I am able to receive funding through SA1L, I have a very good chance of securing a summer position. They have told me to reach out as soon as I hear back about funding through SA1L and although I do not have a specific timeline, I am hoping that we would be able to come to a final decision within a few weeks of hearing back about funding.",https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_1f3EnwPXUTDdq2I,Toronto or London,"In-Person,Remote,Hybrid",,,,,,,,,

Our group facilitated student events and produced informative materials including podcasts, monthly case studies, and guest panels aimed at educating students about wrongful convictions in Canada and how they could get involved in advocacy work. I also had the opportunity to collaborate with Innocence Canada on a number of initiatives and events which helped expand my knowledge of social justice in a legal context and further develop my passion for legal advocacy. I think it is particularly important to inform people about the realities of the Canadian legal system and how quickly innocent people can be caught up in legal trouble. At this stage of my academic career I am more interested in areas of private law but I think maintaining an interest and involvement in social justice work can help to keep me grounded. Obtaining a legal education is a privilege and it is important to use the skills and knowledge to give back to the community in some way. My hope is that working in human rights law and advocating for social justice this summer will allow me to further develop my legal skills while engaging with my community and helping people with the knowledge at my disposal. I am also an intern at Western's Dispute Resolution Center (DRC) which provides free mediation sessions to the community. The DRC's training, led by Robyn Hurley, is focused on developing strong listening and communication skills along with hands-on training to practice being a mediator. Being an effective communicator and being able to compromise are invaluable skills and are helpful in situations where people may have lots of questions about issues they are faced with or even in educational settings during advocacy work.

Through the first semester of law school I have taken a strong interest in areas of private law. In particular, I have found contract law and property law to be among the more interesting topics that I have had the opportunity to study. There is often significant overlap in different areas of private law and I would like to learn more about how contract law works within specific areas of the private sector such as real estate or construction law. During undergrad I worked in construction during the summer and have always wanted to learn more about the legal side of the work including how the contracts are formed and what preparation goes into organizing a large building project. I also have a passion for sports and I think it would be interesting to explore the intersection of law in the world of sports.

Learning more about how mediation is used, especially in family law, has developed my interest in learning about forms of alternative dispute resolution and the important role it can play in solving disputes amicably. Legal disputes between family members can be very sensitive and difficult and so I think having a background in mediation would help me to approach each situation with a people-centered approach and not look past the deeper issues. Learning from Robyn has provided me with a different perspective on family law and the important role that lawyers play as advocates both in and out of court.

In addition to my academic success, my background demonstrates why I would be successful in a private law externship.

I am adaptable and able to thrive in unfamiliar situations. As an undergraduate at the University of Toronto, I was selected for the Jackman Scholars-in-Residence fellowship, an intensive interdisciplinary research program. At the time, I had no experience as a research assistant, no experience with the online platform and tools used during the project, and was generally unfamiliar with interdisciplinary research. However, I threw myself into the work, relying on my strong writing and interpersonal skills to take a leading role in my research group. The project was ultimately reframed based on my input, and I was commended for my contributions.

After graduating, I worked full-time as a manager at an upscale fitness club, where I further sharpened my interpersonal skills through extensive client-facing interactions. As the leader of a team of more than 50 staff on any given shift, I again relied on my adaptable nature to efficiently and effectively address the needs of club members. During this time, I also realized my personal goal of playing competitive hockey and won a championship on a semi-professional team. Once more, I thrived in the team environment and took on a leadership role. Doing so required a serious investment in training and fitness, as well as frequent travel for away games, all while balancing full-time work. I was successful in both areas because of my strong time-management skills and resiliency. 

These transferable skills have served me well in my first term of law school. Despite being completely unfamiliar with legal work at the beginning of my fall term, I relied on my adaptability and writing skills to reach the top of the class in my legal research, writing and advocacy course. I also relied on these skills in my first moot, Westernâs Hockey Arbitration Competition.

What's more, I am interested in a career in sports law. Given that sports law and L&E are closely related, experience in this area would serve me well.

My interest in sports law stems from my personal experiences as a former competitive hockey player. I am intimately familiar with the struggles athletes face throughout their sporting careers. Iâve watched many of my friends play through serious injuries and sacrifice their long-term health under the influence of team staff. However, It was only when I heard the story of Kyle Beach that I began actively planning for a career in sports law. Kyle Beach was sexually assaulted by a team trainer during the Chicago Blackhawksâ 2010 season. The episode was swept under the rug by the president, coach, staff, and players of the team so as to not distract from their goal: the championship that the team would ultimately go on to win. Learning about Kyle's story made me realize just how devastating abuses of power in the workplace can be, particularly in competitive settings like professional sports. It also made me realize how important legal recourse is when such abuses inevitably occur.

During my first semester of law school, I have continued developing my advocacy skills. For instance, I participated in the ESLA hockey arbitration competition, earning an honourable mention despite being the only one-man team in the competition. I was also selected to represent Western in the Hockey Arbitration Competition of Canada. I look forward to any opportunity to continue furthering my advocacy skills and gain L&E experience.",,"I have always been entrepreneurially minded. For instance, I began teaching myself to produce music at a young age, which ultimately led me to operate my own small business. I was successful enough to eventually take on large projects like composing the full soundtrack for an off-Broadway play. I have also dealt with dishonest or even exploitative business partners looking to take advantage of my eagerness to build my portfolio. In retrospect, this helped me realize the importance of legal recourse for young entrepreneurs and small businesses, which is why I now have a keen interest in business law.

Before attending law school, I performed twice as a lead violinist in concerts at Carnegie Hall. I also composed and produced the original soundtrack for an off-Broadway play. My experiences in the music industry have made me passionate about intellectual property law and, in particular, the creative rights of artists. For instance, several of my music colleagues have dealt with the theft of their copyrighted material, many of them with no legal recourse at the time. Whatâs more, with new and developing technologies like AI that can train on copyrighted online material, I believe it is crucial now more than ever to offer legal resources to those in need.

Born and raised in a bilingual environment, I grew up navigating the intersections of identity, equity, and justice. These experiences cultivated a curiosity about the systemic structures that govern human rights and inspired me to pursue a career dedicated to effecting meaningful change.

My academic and professional journey reflects this commitment. At Pepperdine University, my studies in philosophy sharpened my analytical thinking and ethical reasoning, developing a critical approach to understanding complex societal issues. These skills now inform my legal studies at Western Law, where I have immersed myself in advocacy-driven activities such as the Torys Negotiation Competition, advancing my skills in strategic problem-solving and collaborative negotiation.

Founding and managing a boutique Pilates studio has been a transformative experience, allowing me to develop entrepreneurial, leadership, and interpersonal skills. Beyond designing customized programs and building a loyal client base, I used this platform to promote wellness and empower others, especially individuals from diverse backgrounds. Leading a small team of instructors and engaging with clients from varied walks of life honed my ability to listen, empathize, and create inclusive environmentsâskills that are deeply relevant to human rights advocacy.

Additionally, my work at the Global Language Network in Washington, D.C., further deepened my understanding of advocacy within non-profit contexts. By managing social media platforms and coordinating events to promote linguistic and cultural understanding, I developed strong communication skills and gained insight into the importance of grassroots efforts in advancing equity.

These experiences have cultivated my passion and motivation to promote justice and equity.

Being bilingual in Mandarin and English and studying abroad in Switzerland and the United States, Iâve seen how cultural and legal differences can create both challenges and opportunities for understanding. These experiences inspired me to pursue a career where I can help bring people and systems together on a global scale.

My academic background and work experience reflect this focus. At Pepperdine University, studying philosophy taught me to think critically and look at issues from different perspectives. These skills have been valuable in my legal studies at Western Law, where Iâve worked on collaborative problem-solving through activities like the Torys Negotiation Competition.

Starting and managing my own boutique Pilates studio has also taught me valuable lessons. I worked with clients from many different backgrounds, helping them achieve their personal goals and building lasting relationships. Leading a team of instructors and managing the studio gave me strong organizational and leadership skills, as well as the ability to navigate differences and find common ground.

My time as an intern and fellow at the Global Language Network in Washington, D.C., strengthened my understanding of how communication and cultural understanding can make a real difference. Helping organize events and manage communications for this non-profit organization showed me the importance of teamwork and building bridges across differencesâsomething thatâs also at the heart of international law.

These experiences have given me a strong interest in working on global issues, such as human rights or international disputes. Iâm drawn to this position because it aligns with my goal of contributing to solutions that help communities and individuals around the world. I believe my background, skills, and passion make me a strong fit, and Iâm excited about the opportunity to grow and make an impact in this field.","My passion for environmental law stems from my deep appreciation for nature and a desire to protect it for future generations. Growing up in China and later studying in the United States, Switzerland, and Canada, I have witnessed the pressing environmental challenges faced by communities around the world. These experiences have motivated me to pursue a career in law where I can contribute to meaningful environmental solutions.

My academic and professional journey reflects this commitment. At Pepperdine University, studying philosophy helped me develop critical thinking and ethical reasoning skills, which have been invaluable in understanding the balance between economic growth and environmental preservation. These skills now guide my studies at Western Law, where I am building a strong foundation in legal analysis and advocacy.

Running my own boutique Pilates studio has given me a unique perspective on sustainability and community well-being. Beyond managing a successful business, I promoted wellness and mindfulness, values that align with environmental stewardship. This experience taught me the importance of thoughtful leadership, effective communication, and fostering a sense of responsibilityâqualities that I believe are essential for addressing environmental challenges.

During my internship at the Global Language Network, I worked with a diverse team to organize events that promoted cultural and social awareness. While this role was not directly related to environmental issues, it strengthened my ability to collaborate with others, manage projects, and communicate effectivelyâall skills that are crucial for working on complex environmental policies and initiatives.

I am particularly drawn to this position because it aligns with my goal of advocating for policies that protect the environment while ensuring equity for the communities most affected by environmental harm. I am especially interested in areas like climate change policy, environmental justice, and sustainable development.

These hands-on experiences have sparked my interest in business law, where I can help businesses navigate legal challenges and ensure they are protected in their operations.

At Pepperdine University, I developed my ability to think critically and solve complex problems through my studies in philosophy. This foundation has proven invaluable as I pursue a legal study at Western Law, where I have deepened my understanding of business law and participated in activities like the Torys Negotiation Competition. In this competition, I learned how to negotiate business deals and find balanced solutions to complex issues.

In addition to my academic work, my entrepreneurial-related experience at the boutique Pilates studio exposed me to key business operations, such as managing client relationships, marketing, and ensuring operational efficiency. Running the studio required strategic decision-making and an understanding of business principles, which I believe will be helpful in a legal career focused on business law.

Furthermore, my work at Hyperwonder Education involved managing content and marketing materials, which taught me how important intellectual property and branding are to a business. I became aware of how businesses must protect their creative assets and ensure that their brand is legally supported.

I am particularly drawn to this position because it aligns with my goal of helping businesses succeed through legal guidance. I am eager to apply my experience, legal training, and interest in business law to make a meaningful impact in this field.","My interest in intellectual property law grew from my exposure to the crucial role that IP plays in protecting innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship. During my internship at Suzhou Cultural Investment, I participated in a seminar on intellectual property rights, which sparked my curiosity about how legal frameworks safeguard original ideas. This experience laid the foundation for my desire to pursue a career in IP law, where I can help individuals and organizations protect their intellectual assets.

My academic and work experience has been centered around developing the critical thinking and analytical skills essential for success in IP law. At Pepperdine University, my studies in philosophy strengthened my ability to examine complex issues from multiple perspectives. As a law student at Western Law, Iâve applied these skills in practical settings such as the Torys Negotiation Competition, where I honed my ability to navigate competing interests and negotiate solutions.

Beyond my academic work, my entrepreneurial experience in founding and managing a boutique Pilates studio has deepened my understanding of the value of intellectual property. Running my own business required me to protect the brand identity, creative assets, and unique content that distinguish my studio in a competitive market. This experience has given me a practical understanding of how intellectual property law applies to real-world entrepreneurial ventures, and how important it is to safeguard creative work for long-term success.

In addition, my role at Suzhou Cultural Investment involved researching the intersection of IP and creative industries, where I worked with design teams to protect ideas and develop actionable plans. I also gained valuable skills in content creation and marketing through my work at Hyperwonder Education, where I managed intellectual property by designing promotional materials and managing social media content.

I am particularly drawn to this position because of my desire to help creators and entrepreneurs protect their ideas while fostering innovation. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my passion for IP law, along with my academic and entrepreneurial experiences, to make a meaningful impact in this field.",128393.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_Xug9A0d2OTbHc9X,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2q7znc9VwTB9SII,,,,5.0,,3.0,4.0,,,2.0,1.0

My life mission is to help myself and others recognize the inherent worth of every human being by being a conduit of the love I receive from God. My faith directs me to steward the small before attempting the large and not to overlook humble beginnings. I spent the past five years cultivating my gifts of empathy, hospitality, and patience in exercising fellowship and evangelism. I witnessed many stories of provision and redemption through the messy in-betweens that gave me an appreciation for the humanness of others when it collided with my own. My favourite story is about Josh, whom I met on Reddit. Three years ago, he told me candidly that he had no friends and was severely depressed. He was not able to hold a full-time job and was not able to attend church due to his social anxiety. I decided I would be his friend through his season of hardship. I remember supporting and praying for him earnestly, kneeling on my bathroom floor many nights. Eventually, our community grew, and he received a promotion. He recently sent me pictures of fellowshipping with brothers and sisters during the holidays. I am reminded of many stories like Joshâs when flipping through my prayer list.
	I showed God my ambitious faith when I poured myself into fellowship and evangelism instead of building my resume during my undergraduate studies. As such, I did not think that my professional experience would be able to land me a position in law school. I believe that my being here is a promotion from God. Law school gives me the opportunity to steward the large now that I have demonstrated that I can steward the little well. I feel a strong calling towards policy, which was confirmed by my 1.5 years at Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada as a junior policy analyst. My dream is to advance social justice and human rights through working on legal and social policy.",,"I remember idolizing the idea of working for Global Affairs Canada before attending law school. My aspiration started with an International Studies class by Dr. Amyn Sajoo called âAround the World Through Film.â I âfound my fitâ in that class and pursued a minor in international studies. I remember being deeply challenged by my international law course, which was not recommended for me at the time, being a second-year student. However, I was mesmerized by the challenge and hoped to one day master the subject. My favourite courses during my undergraduate studies were all international studies courses, with my favourite part of each class being the research papers I wrote. I remember deciphering colonialismâs impact on the corruption patterns in Southeast Asia, analyzing the best wielder of diplomacy in the Camp David Accords, and attempting to convince my professor that the 2011 military intervention in Libya demonstrated a fatally flawed version of the Responsibility to Protect. Fast forward to law school, I found myself enjoying Legal Research, Writing and Advocacy the most out of all my courses. I would go to bed excited to write, wake up early to revise my drafts and finish my assignments before most of my classmates. The idea of analyzing complex case scenarios by researching and applying the laws of multiple legal systems exhilarates me. The challenge of the conflict of laws particularly captivates me as it evolves with the political climate and rapid innovation, all while remaining shaped by the unchanging historical backdrop of nations.
The two courses I am most confident about are property law and contract law. Throughout the term, I often pondered how the concepts I learned from these two courses would apply to international disputes. It only took my property law professor briefly mentioning âthe conflict of lawsâ in the case of Fletcher v. Boris for me to realize that it would be a great disappointment not to have explored private international law before graduating from law school. The SA1L program would be the perfect opportunity to gain exposure to private international law.",,"My interest in labour and employment law arises from my interest in human rights. Many human rights issues are also labour rights issues. The economyâs viability is entirely dictated by production, and all production comes from labour. Thus, a robust labour force with healthy regulations contributes almost entirely to society's health.
	It is often vulnerable groups that become exploited by employers; as such, advocating for fair employment standards protects the vulnerable. I remember working in businesses that did not adhere to fair employment practices or safety regulations. I frequently complained to friends about how my colleagues and I were treated. Those grumbles stemmed from a narrow, self-centred perspective, as I failed to recognize how privileged I was to have a job that offered financial freedom, allowing me to enjoy a wide range of benefits outside of work. Many international studies courses I took showed me that many people work to live to work. An example would be the palm oil farmers in Southeast Asia and the cocoa farmers of Africa, who are caught up in generational debt cycles, producing to pay back debt, which only accumulates with more work. Many people worldwide lose their dignity due to their work. Factory workers employed by companies like Samsung are exposed to chemicals known to cause cancer. Workers are treated as disposable products. When soldiers sign up for their jobs, they are aware that their employment brings the risk of death, and they can decide whether to accept that risk for fair compensation. Veterans are respected for putting their lives on the line for their countries. However, the producers of products we cannot live without, such as the computer I am typing on, will likely never be dignified through fair compensation for their labour. The global labour market is a wicked problem that I want to attempt to alleviate. ",,"Two traits make me a good candidate for business law practice: my natural interest and orientation toward people and my unmatched ambitious drive, which is invigorated by challenges. 
	I remember excelling in sales as a waitress. I had been a waitress before being employed at the Canadian Brewhouse. However, I found the position challenging as I was pressured to upsell a large and diverse menu. My main challenge was selling over a hundred types of liquor at a time when I was not legally permitted to drink. My tactic was to learn and replicate how my coworkers described and promoted different kinds of liquor. Soon, I received positive and sometimes outstanding feedback from many of my customers. I remember developing regular clients that would request to sit in my section. I vividly recall one customer who asked me how old I was during a very slow lunch hour. When I responded â18,â he was shocked and said he was very impressed by my sales skills and that he âcouldnât imagine how skilled I would be at sales with more years of experience.â 
	After rededicating my life to God after my 19th birthday, I focused most of my time and energy on evangelism. At the time, I was unaware that I had a gift for evangelism but was instead prompted by my natural boldness. My tactic was to make as many friends as possible in any demographic and to invest in their lives. I realized that I had a knack for telling captivating stories, and I became skilled at making compelling cases with my earnest attitude and ability to invite others into my story. Because of my success in evangelism, I often wonder how my skillset might translate into my future career.
	My ambitious drive is illustrated by my asking God to give me a miracle in every area of my life so that I could have the material to make a convincing case for His existence no matter whom I encountered. This often brought on challenges, which I found worthwhile for my cause. Working in business law would satiate my ambitious drive as it demands on-the-go problem-solving and crafting innovative legal solutions under a fast-paced and pressurized work environment.","	Intellectual property law interests me because it encompasses diverse subjects, from the pharmaceutical to the fashion industry. Those who work in intellectual property law are continuously exposed to the forefront of innovation and are faced with cutting-edge ideas. Working in this field would be an excellent fit for me, as I enjoy fast-paced work with pressure in teamwork settings. 
	The most attractive quality of working with intellectual property law is the expectation of crafting solutions by navigating complex situations. When my property law professor explained how the route of patent applications is not a viable business solution for all inventors, I realized that intellectual property lawyers must not only gain command of legal knowledge but also possess a creative mind and an innovative spirit to craft dynamic strategies for clients. I found this expectation of intellectual property lawyers fascinating because I enjoy being constantly challenged on the job. My complaint about all of the jobs I have had is that they were not demanding or challenging enough. I remember always being excited when tasked with a big project, as that meant I could work overtime. I value productivity over relaxation and âvacations to workâ instead of âworking to vacation.â Life is too short to waste, and meaning in life can only be derived from valuable work. The opportunity to pursue mastery through the accumulation of experience is something I look forward to in my legal career. I believe that achieving success in intellectual property law will require dedication, commitment, and fortitude, all qualities I am eager to apply. 
	More broadly, intellectual property law encourages innovation, which enriches society. It strengthens the economy both within national borders and outside of it. A strong economy is the only solution for elevating the quality of life for humans. I want to leave a legacy that positively impacts society.

In my first year of undergraduate, I suffered from intense stress due to my parentsâ fighting, and this stress, combined with my OCD, pushed me to a point where I stopped attending nearly all my classes. I failed most of my courses and came close to opting not to continue with higher education. Deciding to resume my university studies the next fall, my academic performance improved dramatically due to psychological support and my drive to bounce back. However, despite all of my later success in undergraduate, the memory of my first failed year ingrained within me an awareness of the kind of circumstances that can make it difficult for some to succeed in life.  Along with this awareness came a desire to help those who face difficult circumstances and barriers to be treated fairly by society, which I aspire to achieve by advocating for them in a legal setting. In fact, I'm interested by the subject of the differing legal outcomes that people often face due to factors such as social status, race, gender, and class, and how these systemic and often unconscious biases can be rectified in the legal system. It was this same drive for helping to achieve social justice that later led me to choose SWO (Starts With One) as a tutoring organization. When choosing a tutoring agency to volunteer with, SWO stood out to me for its mission to provide free tutoring services to children whose parents cannot afford private tutoring, and especially to children from marginalized communities, such as racialized minorities and refugees. This resonated with my passion for helping everyone to get a fair shot in life no matter the circumstances and systemic barriers that they face, as did SWOâs advocacy for equality in education. Since starting law school, I have found myself particularly interested in Criminal Law and Constitutional Law as avenues for working towards achieving this social justice and ensuring access to justice for all. ",,"I developed my interest in International Law while studying Political Science and History during my undergraduate degree. Taking courses in these two subjects sparked my interest for international institutions such as the UN, the ICC, and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), as I learned about how these institutions were created, how they evolved, and how they function today in order to manage and adjudicate diverse international issues.  This led to a deep curiosity about International Law, as I became fascinated by how international organizations can work to ensure justice, achieve sustainability, and respond to crises in an increasingly globalized world. I am curious in particular about how international institutions can work to better enforce International Law and uphold human rights, and about the different reforms to these institutions that have been proposed in order to meet these ends. Moreover, on a more specific note, in my political science courses I learned about the resource extraction performed by Western corporations in indigenous lands and in the global south. It jarred me to learn that the resource extraction performed centuries ago on indigenous lands by colonialist powers, which I had learned about in my history courses, is in a way still happening in the form of modern mining and oil corporationsâ operations in the global south. Indeed, I discovered how many of the current Western corporations harvesting resources in developing countries even use similar kinds of violence to those employed by the historical colonial empires in order to protect their profits. I felt an acute sense of injustice at this realization, and this feeling was only intensified upon learning of how many of the mining and oil companies operating in the global south are left unregulated, and thus able to pollute the lands, pollute the water, exploit workers, and harm indigenous communities and activists. I am astonished both by the nature of these enterprises and the lack of awareness of them among many living in the Western world. Therefore, rectifying these injustices through reforming and applying international law and conducting global activism is now one of my greatest aspirations. ","My interest in Environmental Law began when I took a Chemistry elective during my undergraduate. In that course I learned, among other things, about how certain industrial processes that pollute rivers and lakes can cause lasting damage to ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as cause harm to the health of human populations. This immediately made me curious about what kinds of laws and regulations exist to protect the environment, and thus sparked my interest in Environmental Law generally. Later on, I learned in Political Science courses about the actions that government agencies have taken in order to defend the environment, as well as instances in which certain governments have contributed to the degradation of the environment through policies such as allowing offshore oil drilling. Through all of this I felt a great sense of indignity at the damage being done to the environment and developed an aspiration to do what I can to help protect it. I recognize that though I may be one little person, if everyone works to support and defend the environment in their little corner of the world then the collective effort can absolutely make a difference. Therefore, I feel a responsibility to act on that basis by defending ecosystems, fighting climate change, and encouraging sustainable infrastructure. I believe that Environmental Law has the potential to help achieve all of these objectives, by, for example, prohibiting logging in protected zones, enforcing carbon emission limits on certain industries, and by continuously updating the list of substances that are illegal to dump into water systems. In this vein, I am inspired by the Paris Agreement on climate change, as well as by efforts of lawyers and activists in general who have created international coalitions to fight for climate justice. The bravery of lawyers who, even while under the attacks and intimidation efforts of environmental offenders, nonetheless continue to advocate on behalf of clients suffering from environmental degradation, impels me to follow in their footsteps. Moreover, I am also curious about how Environmental Law can be applied at both the national and international levels in a complementary manner. ","A key experience that helped spark my interest in Labour and Employment Law was my time working in the meat department of a grocery store last spring. As a meat clerk, I regularly performed physically strenuous work during my shifts, such as heavy lifting, operating and transporting heavy machinery, and hosing down the machines, tables and floors at the end of each shift. In addition, my teammates and I were constantly under significant stress to complete all allotted tasks before the end of each shift. This meant that I often had to rush through working on each of my tasks in order to meet my managerâs expectations and finish on time. As a result of the accumulated stress and exhaustion I experienced because of this, I got sick twice in quick succession, and my manager called me during my second bout of sickness expressing his dissatisfaction with my absence and stating that I might be terminated if I did not return soon. Needing the money and feeling pressured, I returned to work before feeling fully better. Weeks later, I developed a condition called trigger finger, possibly due to slamming the industrial meat grinder lid on my hand while working in a rush, and I decided to hand in my two weeks notice. On the morning of my last scheduled shift, my trigger finger became so bad that my finger became entirely and painfully locked in the closed position. I called in and explained the situation, but my manager spoke to me condescendingly and pressured me to attend my shift anyways, while slightly reducing my duties. It took months for my finger to heal, and the whole experience got me interested in Labour Law, as I afterwards researched the legality of my managerâs actions and whether I had a legal claim. I am now passionate about fighting for employeesâ rights so that nobody has to go through what I did and be pressured to perform work that has harmed them. I believe that people should be able to work in a way which enables them to live happy and healthy lives. ",,,"During my first term in law school, I have developed an interest in new legal areas, and chief among these is Intellectual Property Law. In studying Intellectual Property Law in my Property Law course, I have become fascinated by the case law surrounding such things as trademark infringement, copyright protection, and patent registration.  In particular, Iâm interested in how patents can be protected against claims of prior disclosure of the invention. Moreover, Iâm curious about the issue of how the courts attempt to find a balance between the rights of the owners of Intellectual Property to control their property, and the rights of users to access information. I consider there to be good arguments on both sides of this issue. In the case of patents for example, granting the owners of patents a certain degree of control over their property is important in order to incentivize invention and investment in research by the possibility of financial gains. On the other hand, some amount of free access of information ought to be allowed for members of the public, as this allows valuable knowledge and technology to spread more easily, thus improving lives. Therefore, I believe it is important to balance the interests of the owners with the interests of the users, and that doing so correctly can lead to more invention and innovation while also maximizing the capacity of technology and knowledge to transform peopleâs lives for the better. I find it fascinating how courts attempt to strike this balance in the case law, even if I feel that they sometimes come short of doing so successfully. These discoveries and insights have ingrained in me a passion for the power of technology to transform and better our society, and Iâm intrigued by how Intellectual Property Law can safeguard that potential. All of this has led me to now consider Intellectual Property Law as an intriguing future area of practice. I would be honoured to help make the world a better place, whether by safeguarding works of artistic genius, or by protecting inventions that save lives and increase human flourishing.

I witnessed the more affluent children who were able to pay for more training and coaching land the bigger role. I experienced how families who could afford to put their child in multiple styles of dance come in more confident with the advantage on the child who could barely afford the program. It was there, working with children who knew nothing beyond their reality that I discovered that equality alone is not enough. When discussing with fellow artistic educators the importance of implementing an equitable stance instead of merely an equal stance I used the analogy of two children and three cookies. âIf two children each get a cookie, but one of the children reaches for a second, is that fair?â âNoâ they would reply. âNow what if you knew that the child who reached for the second cookie was hungry and the child who received only one cookie was not?â Their answers, with a new viewpoint, became unclear. 
I view the law, metaphorically, much like I do the children of the analogy. To serve equally is not to serve equitably, and there will always be those who are in need of greater legal considerations. During my education thus far at Western Law it has been stressed the importance of âfairnessâ in our justice system. It is my interest as a legal student to ensure that the fairness I strive for is not only equal, but equitable. I believe an opportunity to work in a public interest role would help me further recognize injustices beyond the textbook definition and grant me the practical training I require to be an equitable lawyer.
",,"Private and civil law work has piqued my interest since starting law school due to the complexities and nuance that it often entails. With these complexities, private and civil law frequently deals with society at their lowest moments, where individuals are navigating personal hardships, disputes, or injustices that significantly impact their lives. This is where the law can be a powerful tool for restoring dignity. For me, this intersection of personal hardship and legal recourse has been a driving force in my professional development.
One of my foundational pulls to law school was to apply a personal and compassionate approach to my practice of law. I firmly believe that legal practice should not only be about providing technical expertise, but also about understanding the unique challenges and human elements behind each case. I see private law as an opportunity to provide that kind of advocacyâworking directly with individuals to achieve fair outcomes while respecting their personal circumstances.
I believe that an opportunity to work in a private law setting this summer would allow me to put this foundational pull into practice. I am eager to engage in real-world legal practice while observing firsthand how law firms and organizations navigate cases and provide tangible solutions for clients. Having a chance to contribute to these efforts would provide invaluable insight into the world of civil and private law, and further strengthen my commitment to making justice more accessible.
Alongside a strong interest in litigation, arbitration, and negotiation, I resonate deeply with the core principle of access to justice. I have seen firsthand, both through my personal experiences and my work in education, how critical it is for individualsâespecially those facing systemic barriersâto have access to the legal support they need. Ensuring that all people, regardless of their background, can access justice is something I feel strongly about, and I am determined to incorporate this value into my future legal career.
Ultimately, my passion for private and civil law stems from the intersection of legal complexity and human dignity. I am excited about the possibility of working with a firm that shares my values of fairness, compassion, and access to justice. I am confident that this opportunity would provide me with invaluable experience and allow me to further my growth as a legal professional.",,,,"When I was accepted into law school I was advised by one of my University Professors: âit is far easier to argue with and deal with numbers than it is to deal with peopleâs livesâ. As a former Bay Street lawyer, it made sense that he wanted me to follow his route, but I knew going into law school that my pull to the legal profession was about more about people and the impact and change that can come from the law. While I recognize that matters within family law are often more emotionally demanding, I believe the benefit to be more substantial. In my lived experience with family law, the clients are often at one of their lowest points of life and require empathetic, but strong, lawyers. When people ask me why Iâm interested in family law, I ask them if they have ever truly listened to people who have come into the realm of family law? Results aside, you can usually figure out who has encountered a personal and emotionally attuned lawyer, vs those who have had a lawyer focused solely on numbers. While I recognize the necessity of separating work and personal attachment, I know that after obtaining my law degree I want to work with, around, and for people. I believe an opportunity to work in family law this summer would allow me to put my desire into practice and further explore family law as a viable career option. With interests in litigation, arbitration, and negotiations, combined with a strength of public speaking, family law is a strong interest of mine, and I would love the chance to explore family law beyond the words of a textbook. ",,"""Insulin does not belong to me, it belongs to the world."" â Frederick Banting, often cited as the âfather of insulin,â made a decision to sell his insulin related patents and intellectual property rights for just one dollar. At first glance, this might seem like an act of selflessness, a demonstration of dedication to the global good. However, for those of us living with Type 1 Diabetes, this gesture is seen with a different lens â one that highlights the stark reality that, in the absence of IP ownership, insulin became something that was commodified. For me, the accessibility of insulin is not just a matter of economics and innovation, but one of survival. 
While I recognize the valid concerns about the monopolistic tendencies that often accompany IP protections, I have come to appreciate its value, especially through my experience in the arts. As an artist, educator, stage manager, and performer before entering law school, I have seen firsthand how intellectual property safeguards creative works, offering a platform for creators to control and benefit from their intellectual labour. The same logic applies to medical innovation, where the promise of IP protection can inspire breakthroughs in treatment and technology.
In reflecting on Bantingâs decision, I find myself contemplating whether a more nuanced approach to IP could existâone that rewards innovation while also ensuring that treatments are accessible, affordable, and not held hostage by corporate interests. It is my hope that as we move forward, we find ways to honour both the spirit of innovation and the moral imperative of making life-saving medications accessible to all. 
I believe an opportunity to work in an intellectual property field this summer would allow me to answer some of my questions, further understand how intellectual property functions in all areas, and grow my interest into the world of intellectual property.

I strongly believe I could contribute positively and constructively to the work done by these great organizations, and I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to join these incredible teams.
I am personally interested in Private/Civil law because of my experience so far in my classes. In particular, my torts, contracts, and property classes have been very engaging and, most importantly, I enjoy the focus on interactions between private citizens instead of the government/private citizen dichotomy in public law. For instance, across the numerous conversations in my torts class, being able to not only uncover the law but the reasons behind the law and its contrast with criminal law have given me a deeper understanding and appreciation.
 In my personal experience I have also gained considerable experience with private law, particularly in contract law. Prior to starting law school, I worked with the National Research Council of Canada. In my role as a Finance Officer, I dealt with contracts between ourselves and clients daily. As I sought to take on more responsibilities, I became more involved in client communications, working directly with Project Managers to come up with solutions when contract issues arose, such as project delays, and getting more involved in reviewing and improving our contract development process. For instance, I was part of a team tasked with demonstrating and providing feedback on our contracting process to upper management to improve it. Following a rigorous review, we were able to significantly increase the transparency and speed of our contracting process by implementing increased collaboration between legal, finance and researchers. This experience allowed me to greatly develop my interpersonal, and problem-solving skills that I believe would be of great use to any organization. ","To whom it may concern:

Upon finishing my undergraduate degree, I began working with the National Research Council of Canada. In my role as a Finance Officer, I dealt with contracts between ourselves and clients daily.

One of the most interesting experiences I had in this role was dealing with our contracts with foreign entities, from countries such as Sweden and Hong Kong. 
These experiences pushed me to explore other ways I could explore unfamiliar areas of the law. I took advantage of UofTâs school of continuing studies, where I had done my undergraduate studies, to take a course in International Business Law and Negotiation wherein I was able to learn and explore international business law. In particular, the intricacies of trade agreements and the changing realities of international trade were intriguing to me as were the history and workings of the WTO and the import/export process. As someone who studied economics in university, I knew of the importance of trade and the recent global spotlight that it has received. It was highly rewarding to examine how nations and industries make global trade a reality. In particular, I found the carful balancing that nations and entities need to engage in highly illuminating because, unlike in domestic law, international law is completely bilateral between nations.
As I proceed in law school and into my career, I am highly interested in further exploring international law in the commercial trade context but also in other contexts such as international criminal law.

Growing up, I gained a deep appreciation for labour and employment law early on from my parents, both of whom are public school teachers. Over the course of their careers, they have been engaged in collective bargaining for their contracts on numerous occasions, including going on strike on a couple of occasions. As the union rep for the teachers at her school, my mother was responsible for communicating valuable information between the union and the staff about the state of negotiations to the teachers and any desires or concerns of the staff to the union. As a result, talk of the collective bargaining would often make its way to the dinner table and elsewhere in my house.
In my personal capacity, I have participated in events hosted by the Labour and Employment Society and after being exposed to the type of work done by labour and employment lawyers, I believe that labour and employment law would be an excellent avenue to exercise my passion for advocacy in a fast paced, dynamic environment. Since high school, I have deeply enjoyed the process of advocacy. In fact, I have set up a personal website and blog to talk about various subjects. I find the process of researching, learning more, and sharing my opinion about these various subjects highly rewarding. In doing so, Iâve been able to work on my research and writing skills as I challenge myself to go deep into these subjects and develop well informed viewpoints which can then be translated into effective advocacy of my position. Further, I have gathered that labour and employment is a fast paced field that offers a strong and steady stream of new files and issues to advocate. This interests me greatly as I much prefer these types of highly stimulating environments which consistently present new challenges and opportunities over slower paced environments.",,"I am a first-year JD student, and I am reaching out to you to present my application for your summer positions. I believe I could contribute positively and constructively, and I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to join your team.
Having completed my undergraduate degree in commerce, I have always been passionate about business. While completing my undergraduate degree in commerce, I learned and applied skills such as analysing companies from a fiscal and strategic viewpoint, and the legal challenges business face. I took the initiative during my undergraduate degree to take the corporate law courses on offer so that I could learn about important corporate law subjects such as incorporation, contracts, and shareholder agreements. I believe that this strong foundation will help businesses with their legal concerns and achieve their strategic objectives. 
Upon finishing my undergraduate degree, I began working with the National Research Council of Canada. In my role as a Finance Officer, I dealt with contracts between ourselves and clients daily. As I sought to take on more responsibilities, I became more involved in client communications, working directly with Project Managers to come up with solutions when contract issues arose, such as project delays, and getting more involved in reviewing and improving our contract development process. For instance, I was part of a team tasked with demonstrating and providing feedback on our contracting process to upper management to improve it. Following a rigorous review, we were able to significantly increase the transparency and speed of our contracting process by implementing increased collaboration between legal, finance and researchers. This experience allowed me to greatly develop my interpersonal, collaborative, and problem-solving skills that I believe would be of great use to your organization. 
In my personal time, I also enjoy reading and writing about many legal issues and concepts, particularly those which relate to business. In fact, I have set up a personal website and blog to host personal projects and articles which include financial analysis tools and relevant business topics such as the advent of generative AI.

My passion and interest for innovation and entrepreneurship has existed for quite some time. While completing my undergraduate degree in commerce, I took a tech strategy course to deepen my knowledge of this area. During this course, we covered all areas of IP, with a particular focus on patents, and how companies can best take advantage of the legal landscape to protect and exploit their IP â knowledge and skills which would be instrumental in advising IP clients
Upon finishing my undergraduate degree, I began working with the National Research Council of Canada. In my role as a Finance Officer, I dealt with contracts between ourselves and clients daily and interacted a great deal with researchers. As the primary scientific research agency of the federal government, the vast majority of these contracts dealt with IP. As a result, I developed a great appreciation for the value of intellectual property and the importance of protecting it. This was particularly the case when dealing with smaller clients whose entire business was often dependent on protecting a small number of patents or copyrights. Furthermore, one of the highlights of this position was interacting with the researchers and discussing what they were working on. Through these discussions I learned a great deal about the process of scientific research and the importance that researchers put on their IP. Therefore, I am familiar with many of the challenges, concerns, and desires of clients in this area.
In my personal time, I also enjoy reading and writing about many legal issues related to IP and entrepreneurship, in particular new and challenging areas such as AI. In fact, on my personal blog I have written about generative AI in relation to copyright. I find the challenge for legal professionals to stay-up-to date with innovative technologies and a large source of my passion for this area.",204221.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_24fxASOJgf9cPkt,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_1rDjLAOnMc7P6I7,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, I focused on how government mandated minimum sentences unlawfully infringed on judges sentencing power; thus taking away many judges ability to properly assess a case and administer a sentencing they would otherwise deem appropriate. My initial delving into the topic only served to further cultivate my interest in the topic of public interest law, which I continued to explore during later years of my undergrad. 

During my third year, I researched and wrote a more in-depth paper on how sexual offences go through the criminal justice system, looking mostly at how the narrative of the 'Perfect Victim' affects how cases would proceed.

I believe these areasâjustice reform, housing, education, healthcare, and povertyâare often treated as separate challenges when, in reality, they are deeply intertwined. The same individuals who are incarcerated often suffer from mental illness or homelessness. Many experiencing homelessness may even seek incarceration as a temporary solution to their need for shelter and food. People facing poverty are often caught in a cycle where limited access to education, healthcare, and stable housing increases their vulnerability to crime and perpetuates their economic struggles.
This vicious cycle is the result of systems that have been allowed to operate without addressing the inequality. For example, justice systems disproportionately target marginalized communities. Marginalized communities often suffer from a lack of access to mental health and addiction care, which is a significant factor contributing to increased poverty rates and higher rates of crime. Educational inequities, meanwhile, limit upward mobility and keep entire communities trapped in poverty.
I want to intervene in this cycle by advocating for policies that address these intersections, and the people impacted by them. Legal advocacy in this space must recognize that issues of housing, healthcare, education, and justice reform are not isolated, but rather overlapping challenges that require holistic solutions.
My motivation to work in public interest law is driven by a belief that the law is the ultimate tool for systemic change. I hope to contribute to dismantling policies that perpetuate inequality and to advocating for comprehensive reforms that recognize the dignity and humanity of marginalized individuals. Public interest law offers a path to not only help individuals caught in this cycle but also challenge the structures that keep these cycles in motion. By addressing these interconnected issues, I hope to contribute to a more just and equitable society.
","Legal protections mean little if individuals cannot practically access the rights they are guaranteed. In Canada, healthcare is universal in theory, but long wait times and regional disparities create significant inequities in access to essential care. Individuals facing poverty or living in rural and Indigenous communities often wait far longer for care, delaying critical treatments and worsening health outcomes. Similarly, while the right to housing is increasingly recognized as a human right, in practice, affordable housing shortages and discriminatory practices continue to push vulnerable individuals into homelessness. These gaps between legal rights and real-life outcomes are recurring themes in social justice work, and I believe human rights law must focus on addressing systemic barriers that prevent individuals from fully exercising their rights.
I am particularly drawn to legal advocacy that addresses structural inequities, especially for marginalized communities who are disproportionately impacted by poverty, homelessness, and lack of access to services. Legal frameworks often assume that once a right is enshrined in law, individuals will automatically be able to exercise that right. In reality, those most in need of protection face systemic obstaclesâsuch as bureaucratic delays, discrimination, and resource shortagesâthat make their legal rights functionally inaccessible.
For instance, poverty is often criminalized rather than addressed through social supports. Individuals experiencing homelessness may be ticketed or jailed for minor infractions, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and criminalization. I believe human rights law must go beyond recognizing rights on paper and work to dismantle the barriers that prevent individuals from accessing housing, healthcare, and justice.
My motivation to pursue social justice law is rooted in the belief that equitable access to fundamental rights is essential to human dignity. I want to work toward legal reforms that ensure rights are meaningful and actionable, not just theoretical promises. By addressing the gap between rights and reality, human rights law can help create a more just and equitable society where all individuals can fully exercise their rights and live with dignity.
",,"My interest in international law stems from a deep belief in universal human rights and the need for global cooperation to address systemic injustices. While countries like Canada have strong legal protections for basic rights, many parts of the world are experiencing significant rollbacks of freedomsâincluding reproductive rights, freedom of expression, and protections against discrimination. This disparity raises important questions about the effectiveness of international legal frameworks in promoting equity across borders and ensuring that human rights are respected in practice, not just on paper.
During my academic studies, I was particularly drawn to discussions on freedom of choice and bodily autonomy, especially in the context of Judith Jarvis Thomsonâs work on abortion and autonomy. These discussions led me to reflect on how international law can help protect individual autonomy in contexts where domestic laws fail. For example, in countries where reproductive rights are under attack, international human rights bodies can play a critical role in holding governments accountable. However, I also recognize the limitations of international lawâwithout enforcement mechanisms, legal frameworks often fail to protect those most vulnerable to human rights violations.
I am particularly interested in how international law can address gender-based violence, which disproportionately impacts women of colour. These are problems that no single country can solve alone, requiring collaboration and accountability on a global scale. However, the gap between international legal principles and their practical implementation remains a significant challenge. My focus in this area is driven by a desire to bridge that gap by ensuring that international human rights protections translate into real, enforceable rights for individuals.
By pursuing international law, I hope to advocate for policies and frameworks that prioritize autonomy, dignity, and equity, and work toward a world where legal protections cross borders and practical access to human rights is guaranteed for all.
",,,"My interest in family law is rooted in a personal understanding of the emotional and financial toll that divorce can take on women and children. Having experienced the long, painful process of my own parents' divorce, I saw firsthand how financial abuse can be weaponized during separation, forcing individuals to choose between staying in abusive households for financial stability or risking poverty by leaving. I believe that family law has the power to break this cycle by ensuring that financial protections and legal advocacy are available to vulnerable individuals.
What draws me to family law is the opportunity to advocate for women and children who often bear the brunt of financial and emotional consequences in divorce. Many women, like my mother, stay in toxic or abusive marriages to ensure that their children have access to financial privilegeâsuch as education and housing stabilityâthat they fear losing if they leave. This is why spousal and child support protections are essential. Family law can ensure that children maintain access to opportunities even after their parents separate, reducing the long-term impact of divorce on their lives.
I believe that legal advocacy can provide a lifeline for individuals going through divorce. The lawyers who supported my mother through her seven-year divorce made it possible for her to keep fighting, even when my father tried to exhaust her resources through endless legal battles. Their work changed the course of my familyâs future, and I want to pay forward that impact by providing the same support to other families in crisis.
Family law is not just about legal proceedingsâitâs about empowering individuals to make safe and healthy choices for themselves and their children. I see this as my opportunity to help women and children leave abusive situations, ensuring that they can build better futures free from fear and financial coercion. For me, family law is personal, and I am committed to making a difference for others facing similar challenges.
",,"I am deeply interested in intellectual property law because it plays a critical role in preserving creativity and protecting ideas within artistic and cultural industries. Art, music, literature, and other forms of creative expression are essential to how we understand ourselves and our societies. I believe that intellectual property law must be designed to empower creators by protecting their works while also encouraging cultural exchange and artistic innovation.
What fascinates me about IP law is its potential to support creative communities by ensuring that artists and innovators retain control over their work. Without proper legal protections, creators may be exploited by larger entities or discouraged from sharing their ideas for fear of losing ownership. Conversely, overly restrictive IP laws can limit access to othersâ works, creating barriers to inspiration and collaboration. Striking a balance between protecting creators' rights and ensuring public access is a challenge that I find particularly compelling.
I am particularly interested in how IP law can help protect emerging artists and marginalized voices in creative industries. In a world where large corporations often dominate cultural production, it is essential to ensure that independent creators can thrive and that diverse perspectives are protected. I believe that intellectual property law can play a vital role in promoting equity and representation by supporting underrepresented artists and ensuring their contributions are valued and protected.
By pursuing a career in intellectual property law, I hope to contribute to creating legal frameworks that support artistic expression and cultural innovation. I believe that art has immense social and cultural value, and the law should work to preserve and protect the rights of those who bring these ideas to life while ensuring that society benefits from diverse and innovative artistic contributions.

This experience not only deepened my understanding of estate planning law but also underscored the vital role accessible legal resources play in empowering families to navigate complex legal systems confidently.

During my time as a student clerk with the Canada Border Services Agency, I gained insight into the multifaceted nature of immigration law and its profound impact on individuals' lives. Interacting with diverse stakeholders further fueled my curiosity about how legal frameworks can better uphold human rights and dignity. Similarly, my work supporting refugees at an immigration firm exposed me to the barriers many face in accessing justice, reinforcing my dedication to advocating for marginalized communities.

My academic and extracurricular pursuits align with this commitment. Serving as Vice President of the Women in Law Club, I organized initiatives to foster inclusivity and equity within the legal profession. Additionally, my involvement in alternative dispute resolution and mock trials has sharpened my ability to approach legal challenges with strategic thinking and empathy.

I am drawn to the intersection of disability rights, poverty, and access to education and housing. These areas highlight the systemic nature of inequality and the transformative potential of legal advocacy. I am curious to explore innovative legal strategies and policy reforms that can effectively address these intersecting issues.

Looking ahead, I aspire to a career in advocacy and policy work, using my legal skills to dismantle barriers to justice and promote systemic change. My unique combination of hands-on experience, academic insight, and deep commitment to public service positions me to make a meaningful impact in public interest law and advance justice for underrepresented communities.

","My interest in Social Justice and Human Rights Law stems from a deep commitment to equity, dignity, and inclusion, cultivated through personal experiences and professional endeavours. My time as a student clerk with the Canada Border Services Agency exposed me to the complexities of immigration processes and the critical role of human rights in ensuring fair treatment. This experience sparked my curiosity about how legal frameworks can address systemic barriers and protect marginalized communities.

During my undergraduate studies, my involvement in the Women in Law Club as Vice President provided opportunities to engage in advocacy and amplify underrepresented voices. Creating spaces to represent women who usually may not have the chance to share their stories was empowering. This role solidified my passion for fostering accessible legal systems and inspired me to pursue a career that prioritizes public interest.

Currently, as a first-year volunteer with Pro Bono Students Canada, I contribute to projects aimed at enhancing access to justice for individuals facing significant barriers. Specifically, providing their families with information would be helpful in the legal process of wills and power of attorney. This work has deepened my understanding of the practical applications of human rights law and reinforced my belief in the transformative power of legal advocacy.

Social justice and human rights law align with my values and aspirations, particularly in promoting equity and empowering communities. I am especially intrigued by questions surrounding the intersection of legal policies and lived experiences, such as how systemic inequities can be dismantled through legal reform and grassroots advocacy.

I bring to this field a unique perspective shaped by my diverse professional and volunteer experiences. Whether working with refugees at an immigration firm, coordinating volunteer initiatives, or supporting individuals with disabilities, I have developed strong communication, organizational, and problem-solving skills. These experiences have honed my ability to navigate complex situations with empathy and integrityâqualities I am eager to bring to my future legal career.

",,,,,"During my undergraduate degree, I took a course on labour in the creative industries. We explored the reality of being a freelance worker, being a part of a union, and advocating for yourself as an employee. I felt so strongly about the importance of discussing labour conditions that I chose to focus on the experiences of migrant workers in Canada for one of my fourth-year seminars. It was eye-opening to delve so deep into the world of labour, and since then, I have been intrigued by the field of labour and employment law. The world only works because we do, and protecting workers is essential to maintaining a healthy society. If workers cannot advocate for themselves, they deserve to have someone who can and will, and I believe that is very fulfilling legal work. ","Family law has always been a field I am interested in pursuing, though, to be completely honest, I am a little apprehensive about it. I know it can be incredibly fulfilling, but I also know it comes with intense challenges. Yet, I keep coming back to wanting to pursue family law. It is an important field of law that encompasses so many unique situations. The family unit looks different for everyone and brings its own set of challenges, and there is something exciting about coming up with solutions that work in each individual case. There is also something to be said for seeing the positive difference you can make in someone's life. Though it seems daunting, I think the positives of working in family law would far outweigh the challenges. Exploring the field while I am a student would be the best way to understand if this career path is viable for me.

As I got more comfortable, I was enlisted to help create proposals for potential retailers, develop cost sheets, and compare landed costs to maximize profit. While these experiences are not directly connected to the legal field, they give me a strong understanding of business operations that would aid in taking on a legal perspective. ","Intellectual property has always piqued my interest, especially as technology has developed. I feel that my background in Communications Studies has given me ample opportunity to explore intellectual property concerning media, and I would be excited to bring that knowledge into the legal realm. The rights of artists and creators, how the online space has evolved, and how the general public views intellectual property are all concepts I've explored with my professors and peers. This field of law is always changing and expanding, keeping us all on our toes. It is exciting to learn throughout your career; it keeps things fresh.

I am interested in, and feel strongly about social justice and human rights primarily by virtue of the fact that I am human. 

I'm grateful that in my life, I have not personally been subjected to anything that I would consider an infringement of my human rights or right to social justice. However, the same cannot be said for my family. I come from a family of Holocaust survivors - my maternal grandparents were Jewish, born in Eastern Europe in the late 1920s. They were both subject to, and overcame, some of the most atrocious violations of core human rights in history. I was raised in their image and I consider myself a legacy to their life stories. The opportunity to fight for human rights would therefore be a true privilege for me, and I know that doing so would have made them proud.

My interest in this field is also supported by my undergraduate education, in which I studied philosophy. I took a strong interest in applied ethics and moral theory, which in no small part influenced my interest in law. Working in the field of social justice and human rights law may be the closest and most effective way of putting my theoretical study into practice, and I am highly interested in doing so.

This class gave me the opportunity to engage in the course material in a uniquely close nature in contrast to other classes. We routinely have fascinating discussions about course content, and this class has helped spark my strong interest in private law.

While tort law is just one part of private law, my takeaway from this course, among others, is that private law pertains to what individuals owe to each other in society. Private law is the evolving answer to this question, in light of the personal, economic, and moral interests that it seeks to protect. This is a fascinating topic to me, in large part because of my interest in philosophy. I majored in philosophy in undergrad and have always been exceptionally interested in broad moral questions - to me, the opportunity to work in private law presents itself as the opportunity to put my love of theory into practice. This is precisely why I wanted to pursue a legal education in the first place.

I'm truly fascinated by business law and the role of business as the driver of economic prosperity in Canada and around the world. Business law is the means by which we safeguard and enforce the interests of Canadians, and our prosperity depends on legal and regulatory systems that promote economic growth, protect people from bad actors, and minimize systemic inefficiency. My interest in business law stems directly from my recognition of the importance of this task, and my desire to contribute to an organizationâs mission in a meaningful capacity.

This fall, I have had the privilege of getting highly involved in my law school community. Notably, I am currently serving as a 1L representative for the Western Business Law Society. This role has provided me with the opportunity to learn more about business law, gain valuable insights of students and professionals with experience in the field, and be a leader on an incredible executive team. I have also participated in several moots and oral competitions, where I further enhanced my collaboration and advocacy skills.

In undergrad, I studied philosophy because I love engaging with fundamental philosophical questions, and I see legal practice as the most effective way to put my love of theory into practice. Studying philosophy helped me develop strong analytical reading and writing skills, and these skills have already transferred well into law school. I'm confident that they will continue to do so in legal practice.

In my professional life, I have extensive experience in client-facing sales, and I'm very comfortable interacting with the general public and providing customer service. In particular, I was trained in consultative sales in my two summers at Diablo Tools, where I took entrepreneurial initiative in my role and developed my verbal and written communication skills.

Intellectual property law in particular appeals to me because I'm fascinated by the concept of intangible property. I was fortunate to have taken property law class with Professor Philip King this fall, and his classes have sparked an interest in IP within me that I never knew I had. Professor King teaches with a clear passion, and he gave life to the field of IP law by sharing stories such as that of Aaron Swartz, which resonated deeply with me.

I was born privileged, with a middle-class background surrounded by a loving family. As I grew up and matured, I became aware that this was not a universal experience. Many people struggle with factors beyond their control forcing them to deal with great hardship. This can range from fleeing a war-torn country to battling life-long addiction. Despite the vast diversity of challenges people encounter, I firmly believe that everyone deserves support, compassion, and the opportunity to rebuild their lives. 
Recognising the disparity in opportunities and resources has instilled me with a sense of responsibility to leverage my privileged position to help others. I cannot claim to fully understand the full struggles of homelessness, chronic health issues, or the many unexpected disruptions that can arise in someone's life. However, I can strive to emphasise and approach each individual with dignity and respect. My goal is to work diligently to reduce the burdens faced by those who have been dealt an unfair hand, ensuring that they receive the advocacy and aid they deserve. 
My academic background has provided me with the skills and perspective necessary for a meaningful legal career. My undergraduate studies in Environmental Science with a specialization in Ecology at the University of Waterloo gave me a solid foundation in analytical reasoning and problem-solving. At Western Law, I have continued to refine these skills, gaining an appreciation for the importance of mindfulness in the legal profession through programs such as Mindful@Law. In my role as a Legal Assistant at Cynthia Weeks Law, I gained valuable hands-on experience drafting legal documents, maintaining client records with accuracy and confidentiality, and providing empathetic client support.

","My interest in practicing private law stems from a desire to work closely with clients to address their unique legal challenges and help them achieve their goals. Working in private law would allow me to develop expertise in a broad area of law while also reaping tangible benefits for individuals, families, and businesses. This dynamic and client-centred form of practice aligns with my passion for problem-solving and delivering tailored solutions. Practising private law early in my legal career would provide invaluable opportunities for growth and exploration. The broad exposure to diverse legal issues across various practice areas, such as tort, property, and contract law, will allow me to gain a well-rounded understanding of the legal landscape. This experience would not only allow me to refine my skills but would also give me insight into which areas of law best align with my strengths and interests. By engaging with a variety of clients, I can decide whether it is best to specialise or to continue to develop a versatile skill set. This foundational period would serve as a critical step in shaping my long-term career trajectory ensuring I contribute effectively to the legal field.

","My interest in practising international law stems from a deep curiosity about the interconnectedness of our world and a desire to address complex legal issues that impact people across borders. International law offers a unique opportunity to work on matters of global significance and engage with a multitude of diverse cultures and legal systems. This field allows me to combine my passion for justice with my interest in large-scale conflict resolution to produce lasting solutions for pressing global challenges. 
I was raised in a small rural community with a rather homogenous population. This produced in me a desire to communicate and learn from people of different cultures. My time at Listowel Technologies Inc. (LTI) exposed me to many people, including immigrants and refugees from Asia, Europe, and Africa, all seeking employment opportunities. My favourite part of working at LTI was talking and learning about the cultural differences and similarities of my co-workers. By practicing international law I will be able to continue learning about the interconnectedness of our world and the diversity of thought and belief.

","My first job in the law was at a small independent legal firm. During this time, one particular case stood out to me and made concrete my desire to work in law. A local farmer who devoted herself to sustainable growth practices and eco-friendly living had several plots of trees labelled as environmentally protected land on her property. Part of this protected land surrounded her house which relied on geothermal heating. If a problem were to arise with the geothermal heating system, she would be forced to apply for permission to remove trees to access and repair the heating system. The reason that these patches of forest were protected was to establish some equilibrium as larger, more ecologically viable plots of land are cut down by developers. 
This case is infuriating to me as both the environment and the small, independently owned farmsteads are the ones to suffer in this not-uncommon scenario. It's my goal to balance the needs of the environment with the needs of small, privately owned businesses as both are frequently overlooked by those pursuing money and power.

My interest in private law stems from a combination of academic curiosity, professional experiences, and personal growth. Studying business administration introduced me to how laws shape relationships between individuals and organizations. This was magnified in my first semester of law school, where we frequently studied the legal nature of businesses or individualsâ wrongs against others. How the law chooses to remedy these disputes interests me.Â 

At Zurich Insurance, I was exposed to private law regularly as it is a key driver of the insurance industry as a whole. This past summer, I worked on a task that focused on understanding Zurich Canadaâs exposure to US auto liability. This project explored the interplay of cross-border legal environments and risk analysis, which combined my passion for law and business. I found it incredibly insightful to see how changes in the litigation landscape affect an insurerâs risk profile and, thus, the cost of insurance. These experiences made me appreciate how legal principles intersect with business operations and decision-making.

During my time as an area manager at Summer Water Sports, I regularly worked with people in high-pressure situations, including conflict resolution with disgruntled clients who damaged our equipment and had to pay for it. This role taught me the value of clear communication, fairness, and practical problem-solvingâqualities essential to my legal career.

Outside of work, my years as a competitive rugby player have shaped how I approach challenges. Competing at the provincial and national levels taught me to stay composed under pressure and to work effectively within a team. These lessons have carried over into my academic and professional life, helping me remain resilient and focused in demanding situations.

I am drawn to private law because it combines problem-solving with the opportunity to make a tangible difference in peopleâs lives. Whether through negotiation, advocacy, or dispute resolution, I see this field as a way to help others navigate complex situations and find fair solutions. I am eager to apply my experiences and skills to a career within this vast area of the law.","My interest in international law stems from a combination of academic curiosity, professional experiences, and personal values. While pursuing a degree in business administration with a concentration in finance and a minor in economics, I became intrigued by how laws shape global markets and influence economic stability. This interest naturally extended into my current legal studies, where I aim to explore the frameworks that govern international interactions.

My experience at Zurich Insurance provided practical exposure to risk analysis and the regulatory challenges companies face in global contexts. I worked on financial and qualitative analyses for underwriting teams, which introduced me to the complex relationship between business decisions and compliance with international standards. These experiences inspired me to think more critically about the role law plays in managing cross-border challenges, such as insolvency and financial regulation.

I also bring a background in leadership, having managed teams of over 20 employees at Summer Water Sports, where I balanced operational responsibilities with conflict resolution and customer service. This hands-on experience taught me the importance of effective communication and accountability.

In addition to my academic and professional experiences, my years as a competitive rugby player have shaped my approach to teamwork, resilience, and strategy. Competing at the provincial and national levels taught me how to perform under pressure and stay focused, even in challenging circumstances. As a varsity athlete at Laurier, I balanced a demanding academic schedule with the physical and mental rigours of high-performance sports, which strengthened my time management and discipline. These experiences cultivated a mindset of perseverance and adaptability, qualities I believe are invaluable in navigating the complexities of international law.

My goal is to address challenges related to the legal barriers to capital access. I am particularly interested in how legal frameworks can be designed to support equitable access to funding while ensuring financial stability and accountability in international markets. I firmly believe that when the global economy prospers, society in general prospers, and the legal frameworks that promote access to capital globally are something I have a deep interest in exploring.",,"My interest in labour and employment law stems from my athletic experiences, academic exploration, and professional development. While pursuing my business administration degree with a concentration in finance and a minor in economics, I became fascinated by how legal frameworks shape workplace relationships and economic opportunities. This curiosity has deepened during my legal studies, where I aim to understand the evolving dynamics of employment law.

My professional experience has solidified this interest. At Zurich Insurance, I supported underwriting teams by performing financial and qualitative analyses, gaining exposure to the intersection between organizational decisions and compliance. These experiences sparked my desire to explore how labour and employment laws can promote fairness and balance in the workplace while addressing operational realities. As a Manager at Summer Water Sports, I led over 20 employees, handling workplace conflicts, performance evaluations, and team development. This role helped me develop my conflict resolution skills and showed me firsthand how effective leadership and clear policies can shape positive workplace environments.

As a former U18 Team Canada and varsity rugby athlete, I bring a unique perspective to labour and employment law. Competing at national and provincial levels taught me the importance of collaboration, resilience, and adaptabilityâqualities that are essential in addressing workplace challenges. Balancing academics with high-performance sports also strengthened my discipline and strategic thinking.

Sports have always been a focal point in my life, and I aim to integrate them into my work as a lawyer. I am particularly interested in the current landscape of NCAA sports in the USA and its intersection with labour and employment law. With the line being blurred between student-athlete and employee of an academic institution, I am keen to see the outcome of these changes and how employment law shapes them. While the work I may do in the summer may not directly address this issue, it would allow me to explore adjacent ideas which I can leverage in my curiosity about the ongoing changes and challenges in American collegiate athletics.Â",,"My interest in business law comes from a combination of academic, professional, and personal experiences. While studying business administration at Wilfrid Laurier University, I concentrated in finance and minored in economics, which introduced me to the critical role legal systems play in financial markets and corporate operations. This interest deepened during my internships at Zurich Insurance, where I worked on underwriting processes and analyzed basic financial risks for businesses, including junior mining companies. Seeing how legal and business considerations intersect in real-world situations confirmed my desire to pursue a career in this field.

Iâve also developed skills that are well-suited to this field through my professional roles. At Zurich, I was trusted to take on leadership responsibilities, mentoring other interns while managing my own workload. As a manager at Summer Water Sports, I frequently handled customer disputes, often involving financial consequences, which helped me develop dispute resolution skills. These roles required clear communication, problem-solving, and attention to detailâqualities that will serve me well throughout my legal career.

What draws me to business law is its focus on addressing complex problems with real-world implications for companies, individuals, and the economy. Iâm particularly interested in mergers and acquisitions and insolvency law, areas where legal decisions can have a profound impact on stakeholders. My goal is to work in a role that combines my understanding of finance and law to help businesses navigate challenges and opportunities.
","My interest in intellectual property law stems from a deep appreciation for creativity, innovation, and the systems that protect them. While studying business administration at Wilfrid Laurier University, I was drawn to how intangible assets like ideas, designs, and brand identity drive business success in areas such as product development and marketing. Laurier Business School's focus on entrepreneurship further highlighted to me intellectual property law's critical role in creating innovation and protecting the value of new ideas for start-ups.Â While we have not directly studied IP in law school yet, I look forward to the opportunity to do so in my upper-year classes. 

Although my academic background is rooted in business and finance, my professional and personal experiences have cultivated skills that align closely with intellectual property law. At Zurich Insurance, I took on responsibilities that required precision, analytical thinking, and problem-solving. I conducted detailed analyses for underwriting processes, developed insights into risk management, and mentored internsâexperiences that strengthened my ability to understand complex issues and provide tailored solutions. Similarly, as a manager at Summer Water Sports, I negotiated with customers and resolved disputes, honing my advocacy skills and ability to navigate challenging interpersonal dynamics.Â 

My years as a competitive rugby athlete also provided me with a unique set of skills. Competing at the national level taught me discipline, adaptability, and strategic thinkingâqualities essential for navigating the ever-evolving landscape of intellectual property law, where new technologies and global collaboration constantly reshape the field. Balancing high-performance sports with academics also helped me refine my time management and ability to perform under pressure.

What excites me about intellectual property law is its dual role in promoting innovation and ensuring creators receive fair recognition and protection. I am particularly interested in exploring the balance between protecting intellectual property and fostering market competition, along with its broader economic impacts. My goal is to help businesses and individuals navigate these frameworks, ensuring their ideas and creations thrive in a competitive and innovative marketplace.",879071.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3hfG6S7RLUyNVte,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_qCIpWIMhYFhB5lv,Toronto,"In-Person,Hybrid",,,,,,,,,

These experiences have given me a profound appreciation for the cultural, political, and legal differences that shape each nationâs identity. More importantly, they have sparked my fascination with how these diverse legal systems interact on the global stage, particularly in the context of international cooperation and conflict.

As a graduate in environmental chemistry, Iâve developed a strong analytical mindset and a deep understanding of global issues from a scientific perspective. However, Iâve come to realize that the solutions to many of todayâs most pressing challengesâsuch as climate change, international trade, and human rightsârequire not just technical expertise but also a nuanced understanding of the complex legal frameworks that govern the relationships between countries. This understanding is critical for creating policies that promote global stability and sustainable development.

To have a meaningful impact, I believe that I must expand my knowledge of international law and its role in addressing transnational issues. The more Iâve observed global events, the more Iâve seen the importance of effective legal mechanisms for resolving disputes, fostering international cooperation, and ensuring that all nations can contribute to and benefit from shared global resources. This realization has led me to pursue a legal career, one where I can help shape and interpret the laws that govern international relations.

The SA1L program offers a unique opportunity for me to develop a comprehensive understanding of how legal systems operate at the international level. I am particularly drawn to the program's emphasis on practical experience and its global perspective, which will allow me to engage with both the theoretical and practical aspects of international law. I hope to gain insight into the complexities of legal interactions between nations, whether in areas such as international trade, human rights, or environmental policy, and to build a network of connections with like-minded individuals who are passionate about navigating and shaping the future of global legal systems.

Ultimately, my goal is to leverage my scientific background and growing legal expertise to contribute to a more interconnected and cooperative world. Whether in the context of international trade agreements, diplomatic negotiations, or global sustainability efforts, I believe the tools of international law are essential for fostering the kind of global collaboration needed to solve complex, cross-border problems. Through the SA1L program, I hope to lay the foundation for a career that combines my interests in science, law, and international relations to address the challenges facing our interconnected world.","I grew up surrounded by the breathtaking natural beauty of Scotlandâs Cairngorms National Park. From a young age, I developed a deep appreciation for nature and the environment. The rugged landscapes, towering peaks, and diverse ecosystems inspired a sense of wonder, but also a growing awareness of the fragility of the world around me. It was this experience that shaped my decision to pursue environmental chemistry at the University of Edinburgh, where I sought to gain the scientific understanding needed to address environmental challenges.

While my academic journey in environmental chemistry and subsequent work in the chemical industry were intellectually fulfilling, they also exposed me to the significant barriers to making a meaningful impact on environmental issues. Despite the vast scientific knowledge available, I found that systemic inertia, limited regulatory frameworks, and a general lack of political will often hampered efforts to implement sustainable solutions. This frustration led me to the realization that the fight against climate change and environmental degradation is not necessarily constrained by the availability of scientific knowledge, but rather by a deficiency in the practical application of that knowledge. In essence, the challenge is not just knowing what to do, but finding the means to make it happen on a larger scale.

It was this insight that prompted my decision to pivot from the chemical industry to law. I believe that, as a lawyer with a background in environmental science, I will be uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between scientific understanding and the legal frameworks needed to drive meaningful change. With the technical expertise of an environmental chemist and the ability to advocate for effective policy change, I hope to play a key role in shaping laws that can protect our planet for future generations.

The SA1L program presents an invaluable opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of how the law can be leveraged to address pressing environmental challenges. Through this program, I aim to gain critical legal expertise in environmental law, as well as establish connections with professionals who share my commitment to using law as a tool for environmental protection. I am particularly drawn to the program's emphasis on practical experience and its focus on the intersection of law, policy, and science, which aligns perfectly with my aspirations.

Ultimately, I see law as a powerful instrument that can catalyze the changes needed to protect our ecosystems, secure sustainable development, and address the climate crisis. By combining my scientific background with legal expertise, I am determined to forge a career where I can have a lasting and meaningful impact on the environment, advocating for policies and practices that will preserve the natural world I grew up with.","Since I began my legal education, one topic has fascinated me more than any other: contracts. Specifically, contracts of employment. As a caseworker on the Sports Solution Clinic, I had the opportunity to sit in on a contract negotiation between our clients - a team of international athletes - and their national sporting organization (NSO). The dispute was with regards to a specific clause in the athletes' new contracts to which they vehemently objected. Their courage and determination to fight for fair treatment and just terms resonated deeply with me.

Getting firsthand experience of watching ""employees"" fight for their rights sparked something inside me. I come from an ordinary background; my parents are both public-school teachers and union members. Throughout my childhood, I witnessed their struggles and triumphs within the union, fighting for better pay and working conditions. These experiences instilled in me a deep appreciation for social justice and the importance of standing up against exploitation.
I would relish the opportunity to use my legal education to fight on behalf of people like my parents and my clients at the clinic who may be taken advantage of by those in positions of power. My passion for employment law was further fueled when I took part in two moots revolving around contract negotiations. Each moot presented complex scenarios that required a keen understanding of legal principles and the ability to advocate effectively for fair outcomes. I thoroughly enjoyed both experiences, which only solidified my resolve to pursue a career in this field.

I hope that, through SA1L, I can gain a deeper understanding of how the law can be used to protect workers. I am eager to explore the intricacies of labor and employment law, learning from experienced professionals and engaging in practical applications of my studies. This opportunity will allow me to build a robust platform upon which I can develop a career dedicated to championing the rights of employees, ensuring that they are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.

In envisioning my future, I see myself working tirelessly to bring about positive change in the workplace. Whether through litigating on behalf of wronged employees, negotiating equitable contracts, or advising organizations on ethical practices, I am committed to using my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact. By standing up for those who may not have the means to advocate for themselves, I aim to contribute to a more just and equitable society where every worker's voice is heard and valued.",,"I do not come from a typical business background. My undergraduate and masterâs degree is in chemistry. However, since beginning my legal education and gaining exposure to the world of business law, I have gained a newfound fascination for the subject.

I elected to study corporate law in the winter semester of 1L because I am excited to learn as much as possible about this subject. The intricate dynamics of corporate structures, mergers and acquisitions, and the regulatory frameworks governing businesses captivate me. I hope that the SA1L program will provide me with an opportunity to further this education, equipping me with the practical skills and in-depth knowledge necessary to excel in this field.

While I do not come from a typical corporate background, I believe that affords me a unique perspective. My scientific training has honed my analytical skills, attention to detail, and methodological approach to problem-solving. These attributes are invaluable in the legal domain, where precision and critical analysis are paramount. I am not rigidly set in the ways of my prior professors and am eager to learn whatever I can be taught.

In addition, while I do not have a corporate education, I do have experience in the corporate world. I worked as a commercial scientist for several years before attending law school. This role allowed me to navigate the corporate environment, understand its challenges, and appreciate the importance of strategic decision-making. My scientific education is also highly relevant to business law in my opinion. My focus was analytical chemistry. In other words, my experience is in analyzing vast quantities of data and transforming them into something meaningful. I believe this is highly applicable to the world of business law as it requires the ability to dissect complex information, identify patterns, and construct robust arguments based on empirical evidence.

Through this opportunity, I hope to build a platform upon which I can forge a career in the field of business law in the future. I am committed to leveraging my unique background and skills to contribute meaningfully to this dynamic field. My journey from chemistry to law has been driven by a passion for learning and a desire to make a tangible impact. I am confident that with the right guidance and experiences, I will be able to bridge the gap between science and law, bringing a fresh and innovative perspective to the practice of business law.

I look forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead, and I am eager to immerse myself in the complexities of corporate legal practice. The SA1L program represents a crucial step in this journey, and I am excited to embark on this path with dedication and enthusiasm.","Human creativity is the most precious commodity in existence today. It is the wellspring of innovation, the driving force behind technological advancements, and the heartbeat of cultural and artistic expression. As a chemistry graduate, I have studied scientists, such as Rosalind Franklin and Eunice Foote, who did not receive the credit or rewards they deserved for their discoveries. It struck me as one of the great injustices of the world that someone could pour their heart and soul into their work, and watch someone else take the credit.

This is a big part of what attracts me to intellectual property (IP) law. I believe that by combining my technical knowledge as a chemist with my education as a lawyer, I can help to protect those who are at risk of having their creativity and effort abused. IP law is a crucial field that safeguards the rights of inventors, artists, and creators, ensuring that they receive the recognition and compensation they deserve for their work.

Intellectual property law encompasses a wide range of protections, from patents and trademarks to copyrights and trade secrets. Each of these legal instruments plays a vital role in fostering innovation and creativity by providing a framework within which creators can safely share their ideas and inventions. By securing exclusive rights to their creations, IP law encourages continued investment in research and development, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.

It is my hope that, through SA1L, I can gain a deeper understanding of how IP law operates in Canada. I hope to use this as a platform to build a career where I am able to help scientists and entrepreneurs protect their work from those who would take advantage of them.

I am currently a first-year law student at Western Law, and my decision to pursue a JD was driven by my strong commitment to public interest work. I am deeply motivated by the opportunity to use law as a tool for social change, particularly in advocating for underserved communities.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked at a financial institution called Alterna Savings. In this role, I interacted with a diverse range of clients, many of whom were from underserved communities. I worked to provide tailored financial solutions that met their unique needs, often helping individuals who lacked access to more traditional financial services. This experience honed my critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as I worked to navigate complex financial issues while ensuring fairness and accessibility.

As a volunteer coach for a girls' competitive team with Pakmen Volleyball, I organized team-building activities and strategic game plans to foster a collaborative environment. Managing a team of eleven players taught me the importance of clear communication, as well as how to both provide and receive constructive feedback. These leadership experiences, along with my commitment to community service, were recognized when I received the 'T.J. Laskowsky Class of 2001 Entrance Award in Law' for my volunteer work. I have also volunteered at Seva Food Bank, where I helped coordinate food collection and distribution, working with other volunteers to streamline operations.

These experiences have deepened my desire to use my law degree to enact change. This is an opportunity where I can apply my leadership and collaboration skills to support underserved communities. I am confident that this externship will allow me to further develop these skills while making an impact in areas where legal support is most needed. 

Thanks for your consideration!

This experience showed me the importance of addressing systemic inequities. I found great purpose in advocating for those who were often left behind by traditional financial institutions.

I had the privilege of volunteering at Seva Food Bank, where I assisted with food collection and distribution, directly supporting those in need in my community. This hands-on experience in social service further deepened my resolve to work towards creating a social change through the law. My ongoing commitment to community service, was recognized with the âT.J. Laskowsky Class of 2001 Entrance Award in Lawâ for my volunteer contributions.

My role as a Case Worker at the Sport Solution Clinic has influenced my desire to support individuals who face difficulties in regards to their physical and mental abilities. Conducting legal research and drafting briefs for Canadian athletes facing sport-related legal disputes highlighted how legal advocacy can directly impact and improve lives, reinforcing my commitment to social justice. 
Additionally, my experience as a Legal Assistant at Balwin Sennecke Halman LLP allowed me to conduct legal research and assist in building civil litigation cases, sparking my interest in how legal frameworks can be leveraged to protect individual rights. These roles built on my analytical and research skills, equipping me to approach legal issues with a balance of critical thinking and compassion.
I am particularly curious about how systemic barriers hinder marginalized communities from accessing justice. Questions around how policies can be reformed to better protect vulnerable groups and how legal institutions can be made more inclusive motivate me to explore social justice law further. I am driven by a strong belief that the law should serve as a tool for equity and empowerment. This externship aligns perfectly with my goal of pursuing a career in civil law with a focus on advocacy, as it would provide invaluable exposure to how legal strategies are crafted to address human rights violations and systemic injustices. 
My diverse experiencesâranging from managing operational duties in corporate environments to engaging directly with clients in legal settingsâhave honed my organizational, research, and interpersonal skills. These transferable skills, combined with my proactive involvement in extracurricular activities like co-founding the Law 'Court Sports' Club, reflect my leadership and teamwork abilities.

",,"My interest in the externship for international law is driven by my academic background and growing curiosity about how global legal systems interact and influence international relations. During my undergraduate studies in the Honours Arts and Business program at the University of Waterloo, I pursued international business courses that provided me with foundational insights into global markets and cross-border transactions. These studies sparked my curiosity about how international legal systems govern complex business operations and resolve disputes between multinational entities. 
I am particularly fascinated by the role international law plays in resolving disputes, promoting sustainable trade practices, and ensuring compliance with global agreements. Exploring questions like how international trade agreements are negotiated or how legal systems address cross-border conflicts aligns with my curiosity about the intersection of law, economics, and global policy.
My academic and professional experiences, international business background and keen curiosity about global legal systems, position me uniquely to contribute meaningfully to this externship.
",,"My interest in the externship for labour and employment law is rooted in my academic background and professional experience working for an employment lawyer. While as a Legal Assistant at Balwin Sennecke Halman LLP, I had the opportunity to conduct legal research and support case development in civil litigation, including employment law matters. Assisting with legal research, preparation of legal documents and analyzing employment contracts exposed me to the nuanced challenges employees face in asserting their rights and the responsibilities employers hold in maintaining fair workplace practices. Moreover, in my office assistant role at Canadian Tire, I was tasked with editing the employee handbook which enlightened me to the vast range of policies that must be in place in a retail setting and other businesses in order to mitigate legal risks. 
I am particularly curious about how evolving workplace dynamics, such as remote work and the gig economy, impact employee protections and employer obligations. Additionally, I am interested in exploring how labour laws adapt to address issues like workplace discrimination, harassment, and wrongful dismissal. This externship offers an invaluable opportunity to improve my understanding of employment law and employer-employee relations.
My long-term career goal is to work in private practice with a focus on civil and employment law, where I can advise clients on employment standards, workplace policies, and dispute resolution. Gaining hands-on experience through this externship would allow me to build on the skills I developed at Balwin Sennecke Halman LLP and expand my practical knowledge of labour law frameworks. I am eager to learn how legal professionals advocate for fair and equitable workplace practices while navigating the complexities of employment legislation.
","My interest in the externship for family law is driven by a curiosity about how legal systems support families through some of life's most challenging transitions. Although I do not have direct experience in family law, I am particularly drawn to the complexities of family law, such as custody arrangements, divorce proceedings, and the division of assets, and how these legal processes impact families emotionally and financially. This area of law is especially interesting to me, as I witness the prevalence of family law issues and disputes often in our society and the staggering divorce rates. 
I am eager to explore how family law practitioners navigate sensitive and emotionally charged situations while advocating for fair and just outcomes. I am especially interested in how legal professionals balance legal obligations with compassion, particularly when working with vulnerable populations such as children and survivors of domestic violence. 
Although my direct experience in family law is limited, my previous roles as a Legal Assistant at Balwin Sennecke Halman LLP and a Case Worker at the Sport Solution Clinic have developed my legal research, analytical, and communication skillsâall of which are transferable to family law. Additionally, my compassionate approach and commitment to advocacy make me well-suited for this area of law. I am excited about the opportunity to learn from experienced family law practitioners and contribute meaningfully to supporting clients during pivotal moments in their lives.
","I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Waterloo in the Arts and Business Co-op program. My co-op positions gave me the experience to work with various businesses ranging from small businesses and sole practitioners to large corporations.
 
Over the course of my undergraduate degree I completed and excelled in business and law focused classes such as entrepreneurship principles and practices, professional and business ethics, business in North America and many more. These classes, combined with my prior work experience with small businesses, have provided me with the knowledge and experience to help small business clients by enlightening me to the processes, commitment, and various factors associated with starting and running a business. Further, I have also completed and excelled in a business law course in my undergrad that covered multiple areas of law including, employment, torts, and partnership agreements - knowledge which I am  hopeful to use and build on. 

During my time as a bookkeeper and legal assistant at Baldwin Sennecke Halman LLP, I was entrusted with the responsibility of managing financial transactions and legal files, requiring precision and compliance with strict regulations. This role sharpened my analytical skills and reinforced my commitment to thoroughness, accuracy, and meticulous attention to detail. I also further developed my research and writing skills through conductive legal research by analyzing precedents and synthesizing complex information to provide clear and concise recommendations to the lawyers. Further, my experience in customer service, particularly as a barista at Starbucks, as an office manager at the Canada Scoliosis and Neuro Centre, and as an office assistant at Canadian Tire, developed my communication and multitasking skills. These experiences taught me the importance of balancing efficiency with a personal, client-focused approachâqualities essential in communicating with clients. These experiences have given me the grit to thrive in high-demand environments and high-pressure situations, while constantly learning and improving.

At 16 I was homeless and living in a youth shelter. It was there that I saw firsthand the number of barriers facing marginalized and underprivileged members of the community. Particularly, I learned just how inaccessible the legal system was for young offenders who grew up in less-than-ideal circumstances. In one instance I went to the courthouse with one of my friends from the shelter âHâ on the day of her hearing. She had been charged with theft under $5000 and fraud under $5000. When we arrived at the courthouse, I asked her where her lawyer was and she told me that she could not afford one so she was just going to represent herself. Despite being born, raised and educated in Canada, she did not know that she was entitled to legal representation in her criminal hearing. We spent the day trying to access legal aid, though ultimately we were unsuccessful. When it came time for her case to be heard and her name was called, I stood up beside her and told the judge what had happened. I asked him if he could help us find her a lawyer before proceeding. The judge agreed and immediately got us in touch with the legal aid office. Ultimately H was able to get her case resolved after a lawyer took on her case pro bono. 
This experience was one amongst many which showed me that there is a large problem surrounding access to justice in Ontario. My goal is to one day follow in the footsteps of the lawyer who took on Hâs case and represent disadvantaged youth in their proceedings. The result of a case should not depend on how well a person knows their rights and the only way to fix this issue is through being a part of the solution. I believe my life experience would make me an asset to a placement relating to social justice and human rights because it allows me to understand the nuances of issues within the field.","Before I began law school I spent 5 months shadowing at a private civil litigation firm specializing in personal injury defence. There I had the opportunity to draft legal memos and attend a trial as well as other legal proceedings (such as discoveries and mediations). 
In one instance I was asked to draft a legal memo and provide the lawyer with an opinion on whether or not the case should proceed to trial. I was given 200+ papers related to the case and while going through them to prepare the legal memo I spotted a major error that was made. As a result, the lawyers were able to go back and correct the error before the pre-trial date. Through that experience, I learned the importance of being vigilant in examining evidence and case-related paperwork and I learned how to draft a good legal memo. 
I was also given the opportunity to go to trial with two of the lawyers. During the trial, I was asked to take notes and provide feedback regarding what I was able to retain and what was difficult to understand. This experience was invaluable because it allowed me to see what goes into preparing for and successfully trying a case in court. For the lawyers, my presence meant that they could get feedback from a person who did not have a legal education, allowing them to adjust their approaches to ensure the jury could fully comprehend their arguments. Furthermore, I got to help with client management. Each day when the client came to trial I sat with them and explained what was happening throughout the day. Later, the lawyers told me that I did very well managing the client and the client had told them it was helpful having me there beside them.
Ultimately my internship allowed me to gain experience in civil litigation, written civil proceedings and client management. I believe I can be an asset to a civil/private law placement because I already have a foundational understanding of civil law and I have learned how to draft legal memos for civil proceedings.",,,"As the daughter of a high school science teacher, I grew up watching my mom join her fellow teachers on strike when the union was unable to reach agreements with the government. My mom taught me from a young age the importance of labour agreements and her union, without which, it would be difficult to address issues that arise on the job. It is because of her experiences that I became interested in labour and employment law. 
Although I have yet the take a labour law course in law school, this year, I took part in the Cavaluzzo/BLG Labour Law moot where I finished as a finalist. My experience participating in the moot provided me with a better understanding of the types of issues which may arise in labour disputes, especially for public sector workers such as my mom. Participating in the moot gave me a new perspective on this field of law as I realized that almost every person in the workforce is impacted by labour law. I also learned that to fully grasp labour law you must understand the legal issues as well as the human impact these issues have on workers. 

If you look at labour issues as purely legal you fail to see the practical implications of the law. However, I am hoping that through working in the labour law industry I can see how the lawyers handle the legal questions at hand while also accounting for the deeply human aspect of the work. I believe that this field of law is very important as it affects nearly every person in the workforce. I believe that my experience growing up as the child of a teacher who taught me about labour disputes, as well as my mooting experience in the Labour moot provide me with a good foundation for understanding labour law and I hope to grow my knowledge of this legal field this summer. 
","When I was 16 I was homeless and living in a shelter and I found myself in a grey area of the law. Although I was a minor, because I was over the age of 16 I could legally be on my own (and not placed in the child welfare system), however, because I was under 18 I could not access welfare resources such as Ontario Works without the consent of my parents. As a result, I could not access funding to get an apartment or to supplement my needs. I realized that I was not the only one facing the predicament. The lack of emancipation laws in Onatio meant my parents remained my legal guardians even if I was not in their custody. Furthermore, because I left after turning 16 there was no child welfare worker assigned to me so I struggled to access resources which others in the shelter (over the age of 18) could easily access. Although it is unlikely that such an issue would arise while working a family law internship, I bring it up to demonstrate that I have first-hand experience dealing with legal issues which arise from family law issues.
I hope that through working as a family law externship I can begin to understand many of the other issues which arise from family law disputes. I believe that working within this field requires great empathy and a string desire to advocate for those who need it most. Working in family law means working with people in one of the most difficult moments of their lives. I want to be able to help people facing difficult family-related legal issues so that they can move forward.",,"My interest in intellectual property law stems from conversations I have had with one of my mentors, a pharmacist who develops AI software to streamline various issues that pharmacists face. Although the AIs themselves are very interesting, I also learned a lot about the legal implications of creating AI software through speaking with him. As my mentor explained to me, when you create AI software you do not start from scratch, rather, the best software is created by building upon available open-access AI software. The way he explained it to me was that you do not âreinvent the wheelâ but rather, you find ways to improve upon the invention. I understand the reasoning behind using pre-existing software, however, I do not fully grasp what that looks like from an intellectual property standpoint. Although I have a basic understanding of the issue from what I have learned in property law class thus far I would like to learn more about the process of IP law. I am interested in learning what a patent process would look like for the work my mentor does. To my understanding, the patent would be made for the âadd-onsâ to the basic software that was used at the start. However, I want to learn more about the issue. 

Furthermore, in the case of my mentor, when the software is developed in partnership with other organizations, who hold the IP rights? I know that in some cases, when you develop IP as an employee the property rights belong to the company but does the same apply when you work alongside another company? Or would it change depending on the agreement made between the parties? 

Given the rapid growth of technology in today's society and the recent surge of AI software, I want to expand my understanding of the topic because IP applies in so many aspects of todayâs society and as a young legal professional, it is important to stay educated so I can expand my learning as the law develops.

Growing up in a community where systemic inequities affected access to basic resources, I saw firsthand how the law could either perpetuate or dismantle barriers. Witnessing these challenges inspired me to pursue a career in public interest law, where I could advocate for marginalized voices and work toward meaningful reform.

In my academic studies, I became particularly fascinated by how the law intersects with issues of economic disparity, racial justice, and access to education. As well, being of Indigenous heritage, I am able to speak firsthand about the amount of inequality present in our society and how marginalized groups are very often taken for granted. Being able to be a voice for those who cannot voice their own has been a big part of my interest in law and the path I took to get here. I want to be able to use this experience as well as this terrific opportunity of law to recognize the tangible impact of systemic inequality and deepen my commitment to advocating for those whose voices are often unheard in the future. 

What motivates me most about public interest law is its alignment with my values of fairness, equity, and community empowerment. I am especially drawn to addressing questions around how the law can better serve vulnerable populations. For instance, I am eager to explore innovative approaches to affordable housing policy, as well as the intersection of legal advocacy and restorative justice practices.

My background has uniquely prepared me for this path. I have cultivated strong research, writing, and communication skills through both academic and professional experiences. Growing up in a culturally diverse environment also shaped my ability to empathize with individuals from different walks of life and understand the nuanced challenges they face.

Ultimately, I see my career in public interest law as an opportunity to bridge the gap between the legal system and those it often overlooks. Whether through direct client advocacy, shaping policy, or engaging in community education, I am committed to using my legal training to advance justice and create lasting change.","My passion for social justice and human rights law stems from both personal experiences and academic pursuits that have shaped my understanding of inequity and the transformative power of advocacy. Growing up, I witnessed the profound impact of systemic discrimination on vulnerable communities, which instilled in me a desire to contribute to a more equitable society. This aspiration deepened during my undergraduate studies, where I was exposed to courses related to human rights and public policy, exploring issues such as access to justice, equality before the law, and the global struggle against oppression.

Being of Indigenous heritage as well as growing up and attending school surrounded by very marginalized and underfunded groups sparked a deep curiosity about how the law can be wielded to protect fundamental rights. It also raised critical questions for me: How can legal frameworks better address systemic injustices? How do we ensure marginalized voices are heard in the pursuit of justice? These questions continue to drive my commitment to social justice and human rights law.

This area of law resonates with my core values of fairness, equality, and dignity. I am particularly motivated by the opportunity to challenge systems of oppression and advocate for policies that uphold the inherent rights of every individual. Whether through direct client representation, legislative reform, or international advocacy, I see social justice law as a powerful avenue for creating tangible and lasting change.

My background equips me with skills that are directly transferable to this field. Through internships and volunteer work, I have honed my research, analytical, and advocacy skills while developing a deep sensitivity to cultural and social dynamics. Growing up in a multicultural environment has again provided me with a unique perspective and the ability to empathize with diverse experiences, which I believe will be invaluable in my legal career.

Ultimately, my goal is to leverage my legal training to advance justice, challenge inequality, and protect the rights of those who are most vulnerable. Social justice and human rights law embody my vision of law as a vehicle for empowerment, and I am committed to dedicating my career to this vital work.","My interest in private and civil law stems from a desire to address the everyday legal challenges that individuals and businesses face and to provide practical solutions that promote fairness and clarity. Growing up in an environment where many of my friends turned to starting businesses through entrepreneurial mindsets because of their circumstances, I was able to observe firsthand the complexities of contracts, manufacturing disputes, and regulatory requirements. These experiences gave me an early appreciation for the importance of civil law in safeguarding rights, resolving conflicts, and fostering trust within society.

Academically, I have been drawn to courses on torts, contracts, and property law, as they highlight the intricate ways in which law intersects with personal and commercial relationships. One particular area of curiosity is how evolving societal norms and technological advancements influence traditional legal principles. For example, how do we reconcile privacy rights with the increasing prevalence of digital contracts and online dispute resolution? These questions challenge me to think critically about how private law can adapt to modern realities while maintaining its core purpose: fairness and equity.

Civil law aligns with my values of problem-solving, collaboration, and empowering individuals to assert their rights. I am motivated by the opportunity to assist clients in navigating complex legal landscapes, whether by drafting precise agreements, negotiating settlements, or advocating for them in court. This area of law also appeals to my long-term goal of working in private practice, where I can contribute to both client success and community well-being.

I bring a unique perspective to this field, having worked in settings where attention to detail and clear communication were crucial. Interning at a financial investment firm taught me how to simplify complex terms for clients and strengthened my research and analytical skills. Additionally, my Indigenous background has given me the ability to approach problems from diverse viewpoints, which I believe is invaluable in resolving disputes and serving clients with varied needs.

Ultimately, private and civil law provide a platform to balance technical precision with human connection. By combining my skills, experiences, and passion, I aim to make a meaningful impact by helping clients achieve their goals while contributing to the integrity of the legal system.",,,"My interest in labour and employment law stems from a deep commitment to fairness and dignity in the workplace. Growing up, I witnessed my parents navigate challenges related to workplace disputes, such as unclear contract terms and unfair treatment, which sparked my awareness of how profoundly employment issues impact individuals' lives. These experiences instilled in me a desire to help employees and employers foster equitable and productive work environments.

Academically, I have been drawn to courses that explore the balance between workersâ rights and organizational needs. I am particularly interested in how labour laws evolve to address modern workplace challenges, such as the rise of gig work, the role of artificial intelligence in hiring practices, and the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion. These issues raise compelling questions: How do we ensure that technological advancements do not undermine workersâ rights? How can labour law address systemic inequities without stifling economic innovation?

Labour and employment law aligns with my passion for advocating for individuals and promoting systemic fairness. This field provides an opportunity to directly impact peopleâs lives, whether by ensuring workers are treated justly, helping employers comply with legal standards, or resolving conflicts that would otherwise disrupt livelihoods and organizational stability. I am particularly drawn to the prospect of engaging in collective bargaining, mediation, and workplace policy development as part of my career. This sector directly relates to the stream of legal work I wish to pursue, which is that of sports and entertainment law as well as private Indigenous law alongside, where I am able to stand up for my clients rights and ensure equality and fairness across the board. 

My experiences have prepared me well for this path. Working for a while at a major corporation as a unionized customer service associate, I assisted with customer and fellow employee disputes, honing my ability to analyze fairness and communicate my perspective fairly and clearly. Additionally, my part-time work while studying gave me firsthand insight into the challenges faced by employees in precarious jobs, reinforcing my commitment to addressing inequities in the workplace. My background equips me with empathy and a practical understanding of the real-world implications of employment issues.

My personal experiences as a Muslim woman of color who immigrated to Canada from Pakistan at the age of 13 have shaped my interest in advocating for marginalized and vulnerable populations. As an immigrant, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by individuals navigating complex systems, such as immigration, housing, and healthcare, often with limited resources. These experiences sparked my desire to pursue a legal career focused on ensuring that vulnerable communities have access to justice and fair treatment.

Through my undergraduate studies in Political Science and my work with organizations like Islamic Relief, I have developed a strong foundation in understanding the intersection between law and public policy. I have worked closely with refugee and immigrant populations, gaining insight into the hurdles they face in areas such as housing insecurity and limited access to legal resources. This exposure has fueled my curiosity about how the law can be used to address systemic inequities in these areas, and I am eager to explore legal frameworks that support social justice and human rights.

As an immigrant woman of color, I have experienced firsthand the subtle yet impactful nature of microaggressions and the challenges they present in navigating both everyday life and legal systems. These experiences have ignited my desire to fight for equitable access to justice for all individuals, particularly those who are underrepresented or lack the resources and support needed to advocate for themselves.

Throughout my academic career, I have been drawn to issues surrounding discrimination and inequity, particularly how microaggressionsâwhether in the workplace, the healthcare system, or in legal contextsâcan disproportionately affect marginalized communities. Iâve observed how these subtle forms of bias contribute to larger patterns of exclusion, which in turn perpetuate inequalities in access to education, employment, and legal recourse. This has fueled my curiosity to understand how legal frameworks can be used to combat these daily injustices and promote institutional change.

I aim to focus on creating inclusive legal systems that protect the rights of those who face multiple layers of disadvantageâwhether due to race, socioeconomic status, education, or language.

These roles have taught me to engage empathetically with individuals from diverse backgrounds and to listen actively in order to understand their needs and challenges.

My fascination with international law began during my undergraduate studies, particularly through courses like Global Law and Courts, where I explored the intersection of legal frameworks across borders and their impact on human rights, conflict resolution, and governance. Additionally, my field study experience at The Hague, where I had the opportunity to visit the International Criminal Court (ICC), further solidified my interest in the global justice system. Seeing firsthand how international institutions address war crimes and crimes against humanity was both inspiring and eye-opening, reinforcing my desire to contribute to the field of international law.

My passion for human rights and international law is deeply rooted in my personal experience as an immigrant and my exposure to refugee communities. Having worked with refugees and immigrants, I have witnessed the profound challenges they face in navigating both their legal status and the complex international systems that govern their rights and protections. This has given me a deep appreciation for how critical international law is in providing protections for vulnerable populations, particularly in conflict zones or regions with authoritarian regimes.

I am particularly curious about how international legal frameworks can be used to address issues such as refugee rights, asylum policies, and state accountability for human rights violations. I am eager to explore how institutions like the UNHCR and the ICC balance state sovereignty with the imperative to protect human rights across borders. This externship represents an invaluable opportunity to deepen my understanding of how international law can be applied to real-world issues, particularly for vulnerable communities.

I bring strong research and analytical skills from my academic work, including experience analyzing complex legal cases and frameworks in international law.

Throughout my academic journey, I have become increasingly aware of the profound impact that environmental issues have on both our planet and its most vulnerable communities. My interest in environmental law stems from the belief that law can serve as a powerful tool to drive the changes needed to address environmental degradation, mitigate climate change, and ensure the protection of natural resources for future generations.

Growing up, I witnessed the growing concern over environmental degradation in my home country, and it inspired me to think critically about the role of legal frameworks in addressing these global challenges. I am particularly passionate about how environmental law can shape public policy and influence corporate responsibility to adopt sustainable practices. I see law as a means to not only hold individuals and corporations accountable but also to foster a more holistic approach to development, one that balances human progress with environmental preservation.

In my studies, I have come to realize that legal frameworks are essential in shaping the future of our environment. Through research and coursework in environmental policy and law, Iâve learned how regulations and international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, can create tangible solutions to global issues like climate change, deforestation, and resource depletion. I am particularly interested in how international environmental law can play a role in mitigating the global nature of these crises, especially in the face of rapid urbanization and industrialization.

This externship is a perfect opportunity for me to further explore how law can positively shape environmental outcomes and ensure the preservation of resources for future generations. I am eager to contribute my skills in research, critical thinking, and advocacy while learning how legal professionals are addressing some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time","I am eager to apply for the Labour and Employment Law Externship because of my deep commitment to advocating for workersâ rights, particularly those who are vulnerable due to lack of education, access to legal resources, or awareness of their rights. Over the years, I have witnessed several individuals in my community who were wronged by their employersâfacing unjust layoffs, unfair contracts, and even exploitation in the workplace. These experiences have motivated me to pursue a career in labour law, where I can work to ensure that all workers are treated fairly and have access to justice, regardless of their background or economic status.

Through personal connections, I have seen workers face unlawful termination without proper severance, underpaid wages, and exploitative contracts that were imposed on them without fully understanding the legal consequences. Many of these individuals were unaware of their legal rights, and without the proper knowledge or resources to seek help, they were forced to accept unfair treatment. This lack of access to justice deeply troubled me and sparked my interest in labour and employment law as a way to level the playing field for workers, particularly those who lack the education or resources to stand up to exploitation.

In my academic studies and personal experiences, Iâve come to understand how vital legal frameworks are in protecting employees from exploitation and ensuring that workplaces are fair, safe, and equitable. I am particularly interested in issues like wrongful dismissal, discrimination in the workplace, and contract enforcement, as Iâve seen how these issues affect real people. I believe that the law can serve as a tool for empowering workers, helping them understand their rights and providing them with avenues for recourse.

This externship represents an opportunity for me to combine my passion for social justice with my desire to support individuals who have been wronged by their employers.

In doing so, I have volunteered with my local community services organization as well as with HanVoice Canada - a human rights advocacy group focusing on North Korean injustices. My volunteering experiences placed me on the front lines of social change. With Caledon Community Services, I contributed as a head office receptionist, a charity event organizer, and a donation centre assistant.

As a donation centre assistant, it was my responsibility to receive and process second-hand electronic goods to be made available to the community at affordable prices. With HanVoice, I volunteered with the Peopleâs Museum of North Korea exhibit in Toronto. The exhibitâs objective was to shift North Korean narratives, and shed a light upon the unheard stories of North Korean resilience.

I understand the need and importance of addressing societal issues and challenges, and am passionate about doing all that I can to inspire change and improvement.","Although my feelings about social justice and human rights law are very similar to those of public interest, I will add that I am a person living with a permanent disability (hearing impairment). Through my disability, I have been exposed to a life of challenges and obstacles that I have had to overcome to achieve my goals. Through an externship oriented in social justice and human rights, I hope to be a beacon of hope for those struggling to overcome their own obstacles. With first-hand knowledge and experience, I am confident that I will contribute effectively and efficiently in working toward my team's objectives and needs. ","In addition to my interests in public law, I am also fascinated by the private and civil sector. Although I am not as familiar with these sectors, my first term of 1L at Western has exposed me to the many facets that they entail. I especially enjoyed my first terms of property and tort law, and through an externship, hope to learn more about these dynamic fields. In particular, I have an interest in labour and employment law. Although this field of law has many intersections with the public sphere, I hope to further explore the branch of civil liabilities related thereto (accidents in the workplace, health and safety standards, contracts of employment, etc.).","Again related to my interests in public law, I have a passion for international law and relations. I believe that although the judicial branches of Canadian law work tirelessly in creating change, many societal determinations are made at the political level. Having graduated from my undergraduate studies with a major in history and a minor in political science, I am well-versed in the subject of politics and international relations. I am intrigued by comparative systems of governance, and would be interested in applying my experiences and expertise to an ever-evolving and dynamic field with immediate, and sometimes drastic, societal repercussions.","Environmental law is a field that intrigues, yet also baffles me. Time and again society learns of the deteriorating state of the world, and still environmental atrocities continue to persist. Every day it appears that another part of the world has been struck with disaster and destruction. A lot of what occurs environmentally is the product of human creation. The capitalist system and globalization has allowed corporations to abuse both the natural environment, and those people inhabiting it, to their benefit - unchecked. Hence, with my passion in public law, I believe that I would be a great fit, and well-equipped, to participate in an externship focused in environmental law. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a journalist for my university's student newspaper. In this role, I wrote various articles about environmental issues, and suggested ways that the world, or at least the student population, could go about addressing them. Through an externship position, I hope to turn my words into action, and/or discover more about this topic. I am a firm believer in holding people accountable for their actions, and, although not as familiar with environmental law as I am with other fields, I believe that an environmental law externship will teach me more about the issues (and how to work toward solving them) that affect me, and everyone around me.",,,,,660582.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_6JvkBK55A1mMFnr,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3feonjbiuy4tzYk,Toronto/Peel Region/GTA,"In-Person,Hybrid",,,,,,,,,

After a few weeks into the start of the school year, I could already tell that Contracts, Property, and Tort law were my favourite classes. I found myself more engaged with the readings and material for these courses and was particularly interested in its broader applicability. I find that I can draw on many of my own personal experiences that relate to private law matters.  ","While my experience with this area is limited, I am interested in exploring how international law is shaped by various cultures and perspectives. In my undergraduate program, I had the opportunity to study abroad for a semester in France. At my exchange school, I decided to take a French language course to truly immerse myself in the French culture. My class was comprised entirely of international students who were also on exchange. I learned a lot about many different cultures and how similar they were to Canadian culture but also vastly different in other aspects. It was fascinating to hear what other people from around the world thought of when I said that I was from Canada.  ",,"In my contracts class, we have spent a lot of time discussing employment contracts and the common issues that can arise in employment agreements. In class, we examined different scenarios related to just cause dismissal. One aspect of employment relationships that stood out to me was the power inequality between employers and employees. Employers have a disproportionate number of resources compared to employees, especially in cases where the employer is a large corporation. I am particularly interested in advocating for employees to ensure they are treated fairly and their rights are protected in the workplace. I find this area very interesting and a great application of the concepts we are learning in contract law. I believe learning more about labour and employment law will be greatly beneficial to both my professional and personal development. ",,"The area of business law has been a strong interest of mine for the past two years. In my undergraduate program, I took a business law course and really enjoyed the material. My experience with this course inspired me to apply to law school as I could see myself practicing in this area of law in the future. Over my past two summer internships, Iâve had the opportunity to speak with my companyâs in-house counsel as well as my colleague who was a summer law student. They described their experience with the company and what type of work is typical for a corporate/commercial lawyer. Although I had not yet started law school at the time, their work was interesting to me and got me excited to further my learning at law school.  ","The area of intellectual property (IP) law is very interesting to me. In my property class, we had the opportunity to learn about IP law and how copyrights and trademarks can help protect an IP right. IP is a topic that I have always been curious about. I interact with countless brands and corporations in my day-to-day life, many of whom have iconic logos, slogans, and technology. As a relatively new form of property that has emerged it is interesting to see how the internet and social media has shaped IP law. Information is more accessible than ever. People misusing and illegally obtaining/distributing a work is a legitimate concern to many artists and owners of IP.  

I am also on the executive team of the Western Venture Law Society which aims to promote the practice of venture law in the Western community. Many venture lawyers have shared with me that clients in this space are typically startups/entrepreneurs. Learning more about IP law would be beneficial if I were to pursue venture law in the future.

With this academic background and hands-on pro-bono legal experience, I am committed to advancing social justice and human rights through impactful legal work.
My pro bono work with the Hamilton Legal Clinic allowed me to support vulnerable populations navigating immigration law. Assisting clients in accessing essential legal resources highlighted the importance of fostering equal opportunities for those most in need. This experience deepened my understanding of systemic barriers and reinforced my dedication to advocating for marginalized communities.
My coursework in international relations emphasized human rights frameworks and global governance, providing me with a robust understanding of the legal mechanisms that protect vulnerable populations. One fourth-year seminar course, in particular, propelled my scholarship in understanding the importance of NGO-state interaction and collaboration, how leadership shapes policy responses to critical issues, and the importance of NGOs in both global politics and local humanitarian crises â whether they are long-standing and endemic to a population or sudden and catastrophic. Through this academic training, I developed the analytical skills to address human rights challenges and proposed actionable solutions to complex issues. This vast academic experience, combined with my legal education, position me to tackle a wide range of social justice issues, with a focus on peoples' lived experiences and the crucial need for their own input to find solutions.
My family came to Canada in search for a life of social, economic, and political freedom after decades of enduring a communist dictatorship which eliminated free speech and all political discourse, interrupted the free flow of information, restricted citizensâ movement, and committed humanitarian atrocities. Growing up in Canada and hearing stories of my familyâs past, I am perpetually conscious of the privilege I have living in a free, democratic society â my hope, in coming to law school, has been to give back and contribute what I can to better the lives of those less privileged than me. Creating the opportunity for equal legal representation and bolstering an accessible global reality that upholds the rule of law is my goal.  
Whether supporting asylum seekers, advocating for equitable policies, or addressing systemic barriers, I am driven by a commitment to foster fairness and inclusion.
Joining a team where I have the possibility of contributing to promote justice and uphold human rights would by an incredible honor, as it would provide an invaluable opportunity to apply my skills, deepen my expertise, and contribute to meaningful change in the pursuit of social justice and equity.",,"International law captivates me for its ability to address global challenges and foster cooperation across borders.

I have a strong foundation in international relations and a passion for advancing global legal norms and am eager to put my research and analytical skills to real-world use in the sphere of international law.
Throughout my International Relations major, I have succeeded in a wide breadth of academically demanding courses and seminars focusing on international law, global governance, macro and microeconomics, global conflict, and major power competition. As part of my degree, I have conducted several original research projects and theses, evaluating how leader personality affects foreign policy, identifying the factors predicting state stability after global health crises, and how psychological dynamics impact moral decision making. My original research on global cybersecurity risks explored the interplay between national sovereignty and international cooperation, delving into legal agreements and legislative frameworks to address pressing issues like data privacy. This experience deepened my understanding of how international law evolves to meet emergent challenges. I am particularly interested in areas such as international trade, human rights, and dispute resolution, where my academic background in geopolitics complements my legal studies. My systematic approach to research equips me to navigate complex legal disputes, ensuring clarity and precision in addressing transnational issues.
n addition to individual projects, I have also contributed to broader research initiatives, notably, a collaborative project between the University of Toronto and Stanford University aimed at creating a novel education reform research database. Through this experience, I honed my ability to handle extensive primary-source policy documentation from organizations including UNESCO and the World Bank. This reinforced my capacity to analyze and synthesize vast amounts of information on a large scale. 
Working in the field of international law over the summer would be an invaluable opportunity to develop my expertise in understanding how real-world legal work can lead towards solutions that promote international cooperation and justice. I hope to pursue a career within international law, public or private, whether by representing Canadian interests abroad, aiding NGOs like the UN or the Red Cross in carrying out their humanitarian mandates, or by advising on the legal aspects of international business operations, trade, or venture capital initiatives.

My research assistant role at the Munk School of Global Affairs involved analyzing international education policies and synthesizing data in a collaborative project between the University of Toronto and Stanford University aimed at creating a novel education reform research database. This work demanded meticulous attention to detail, collaboration across disciplines, and the ability to evaluate the implications of policy decisions on diverse stakeholders. Sharpening my ability to interpret legal frameworks and identify practical solutions, these analytical research skills are invaluable in evaluating employment laws and advising clients on compliance and best practices.
I am particularly drawn to the potential for litigation in labour law, as it offers opportunities to directly advocate for workersâ rights and promote systemic change. I am particularly drawn to the potential for litigation in labour law, as it offers opportunities to directly advocate for workersâ rights and promote systemic change. Competing in the BLG/Cavalluzzo Labour Law Moot, which centered on a real-world constitutional challenge between Ontarioâs largest public worker unions and the provincial government over capped pay increases, provided me with firsthand experience in analyzing complex labour disputes. This case deepened my understanding of the intersection between constitutional law and workersâ rights, while honing my oral advocacy, legal reasoning, and ability to construct persuasive arguments under tight deadlines. The moot reinforced my passion for addressing systemic inequities and protecting workersâ interests through impactful legal representation.The possibility of working both with unions and businesses to advance workplace equity and represent people in need resonates deeply with my aspirations.

Business law excites me for its dynamic nature and potential to drive economic growth and organizational success. As a law student with a background in international relations, I am eager to leverage my academic and practical experiences to navigate the intricate legal landscapes businesses face today.
My roles as the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Editor-Analyst for Avrasya, a new academic journal at the Munk School of Global Affairs, have given me incredible insight into the challenges faced by start-ups, the hurdles and requirements needed to secure funding, and regulatory matters crucial to the establishment of a business-like organizationâa parallel experience to the needs faced by clients. This experience has allowed me to grasp the financial and operational needs of businesses â essential components in providing effective legal counsel in a business law context. 
My participation in the Torys Negotiation Moot further refined my ability to craft persuasive arguments, analyze opposing positions, and achieve favorable outcomes in high-pressure situations. This hands-on experience in negotiation and advocacy strengthened my understanding of contractual intricacies and dispute resolution, essential for business law practice.
For nearly the past ten years, I have been a tennis coach at several high-performance tennis clubs in Toronto, including the NYTA, Don Mills Tennis Club, and Tournament Park Tennis Club. Progressing from a Junior Instructor to an Assistant Head Coach with Tennis Canada credentials, I have been exposed to the day-to-day operations of small businesses in this area of sport â alongside the operations of the clubs themselves â many of which have shown unexpected needs for legal aid and advice. These lived experiences which were part of my employment give me firsthand experience and an appreciation for the needs of potential clients in the nature of the questions they have, the format in which explanations can be understood, and the utmost need for punctuality and thoroughness in case evaluation.

This unique combination of my rigorous scientific background, problem-solving analytical skills, and long-standing desire to work in intellectual property law makes me well-suited to contribute meaningfully to any opportunity in this sector.

Throughout my life, I have been extremely interested towards working in and around technological fields, a love fostered by my parents who are both engineers. In my free time, I often follow the developments of patent applications and litigation, particularly within the technology and automotive sectors. For many years, I have wanted to understand how patents are developed, how the unique characteristics of intellectual property are evaluated and protected, and how legal developments affect innovation and development. My undergraduate education in the areas of human cognition and neuroscience, has equipped me with a solid foundation in research, scientific processes, and technical analysis â essential skills for navigating the technical complexities of intellectual property law. My studies in these fields have sparked my interest in IP law within the scientific and medical sector as well, and my substantial exposure to laboratory work makes me confident in my ability to grasp the practical aspects of such IP cases. 

At the same time, this experience makes me intimately familiar with the necessity in and difficulty of safeguarding intellectual property, such as particular research methodologies and testing standards that are now protected. With a deep understanding of how many medical technologies and laboratory devices function, working in this area of law will allow me to leverage my knowledge in science and technology to effectively contribute to the legal work that protects and fosters innovation. My original research on global cybersecurity risks further cemented my interest in the intersection of technology and law. Analyzing international legal agreements and legislation, I proposed policies addressing privacy and security issues posed by global tech companies, highlighting my aptitude for addressing emergent legal challenges in technology and intellectual property. This has fostered my understanding of the critical role played by intellectual property in a rapidly evolving world.

While in my undergraduate degree, I doubted my abilities to pursue a legal career due to the lack of connections in law, parents with professional careers like my other peers, and coming from a single low-income family. Despite this, overtime I began to view that this is not a weakness but is a source of strength as it shaped me to the resilient and dedicated individual I am today. I acknowledge the obstacles I had to face to get to where I am, but this allows me to have a greater perspective on life. Going into law school and having a goal of becoming a future family lawyer, I aim to advocate for underserved communities and help others overcome barriers they may face to show that justice is possible. I have a goal of reforming the justice system that creates better sense of trust in individuals. From my personal experiences, I acknowledge the importance of needing greater resources for the public in areas of health, housing, poverty, and many more that requires. I aim to be the voice of activism that provides individuals the motivation to advocate for their needs and come up with solutions on how they can be solved. ","Growing up with a single mom who worked extremely hard to provide for her children, social justice and human rights has always been something I am passionate towards. My mother taught me to never give up and be a part of the solution women strive when faced with the many barriers they face. Social justice is a significant aspect that I am passionate about as it is a vital aspect in society as it allows individuals to have a right to equality dignity, freedom from discrimination, and many more. My goal after law school is to become a family law attorney and help those who are underprivileged, particularly women who face barriers to access the justice system receive greater accessibility. I strive to help provide them a platform in which they feel encouraged to voice their opinions on their needs for social justice and human rights. While volunteering for a senior rights project with Pro Bono Students Canada during my fall semester, I gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of supporting vulnerable individuals and experienced how rewarding this work can be. As a law student, I believe it is essential to use our knowledge to assist those in need. This opportunity provides me with great experience of expanding my knowledge and having a greater step to my goal of helping with social justice and human rights. ","I am interested in private/civil law as it aids in addressing real world situations that protects individuals and the impacts that can be made on their lives both privately and professionally. It allows for a greater opportunity to work closely with clients to accommodate to their needs and develop any solutions aligned with their goals. By working with clients, there is a greater opportunity to be exposed to different experiences and perspectives that results in gaining greater knowledge. Furthermore, working several years in customer service, I strengthened my skills of being able to communicate efficiently to customers, addressing their needs to find solutions effectively while also being able to manage other tasks in a fast-paced environment. Actively listening to customers and collaborating with them allows for the creation of the best solutions, ensuring seamless operations. When my mother obtained full custody of my sister and I, the justice system including child support workers took the time to listen to our family and provide us with the justice we needed. I wish to improve on these skills even more while working in private/civil law so that when I pursue my goal of becoming a family lawyer and use my skills to address family matters, contributing to the justice that families in need deserveâjustice that my own family was fortunate to experience.","International law interest me as it looks on the different legal systems in the world and how effective solutions can be created for different pressing global issues. Growing up with parents who immigrated from another country, I grew up with strong values of promoting justice on an international scale. From a young age, I participated in Polish scouting that gave me the opportunity to embrace and learn more about my culture. I frequently visited the old age home with my scouting and had the opportunity to listen to many individualsâ stories about their struggles in their countries. At that time, we were able to help them by listening to them and spending time with them, but this created a greater passion of advocating for human rights law globally. As Canada is a diverse country, it is important that all individuals can feel safe to embrace their cultures and working in international law aligns with my values of promoting justice and peace on a global scale. Additionally, while in my undergraduate degree I found myself curious with international law while taking a course on the politics regarding climate change. I learned the importance of global adhesion when working on important issues such as climate change and am interested in learning more on this topic and the potential solutions that can be created. International law provides the opportunity to give a platform for individuals to feel empowered and speak upon global issues that can help shape policies to help solve any pressing issues. By being able to gain experience within international law, I can be a part of the change I hope to see on a global scale with pressing issues that impacts all individuals.

With the justice system, my mom was able to get full custody and provide a feeling of safety for me that provided me with a vision of the lengths that the justice system can go through to protect a family in need. This provided me with a passion for social justice from a very young age. Going into law school, I knew my goal was to provide this justice my family was able to receive is to become a family lawyer and help women and children who need legal protection but have difficulty accessing it. Although I may come from a lower socio-economic background with a single mother, I believe this experience has provided me with a unique perspective on life and to the law. I intend to advocate for accessibility within legal resources while emphasizing the importance of providing families with justice. Additionally, I have many years of experience working in the customer service field that has provided me with many necessary transferable skills. Working as a food server in hospitality, I have gained strong conflict-resolution skills which allows me to come up with solutions in a fast manner to ensure customers are satisfied. I also was able to improve on my team collaboration skills as I needed to work well with others to ensure any actions were done seamlessly. Task-management skills were also a skill I significantly improved on as I was able to learn tasks quickly and was able to effectively focus on more than one task and execute them with my best efforts. Overall, I believe my personal experiences that created a significant passion for me alongside my work experience created an individual with a hard-working mindset and ability to take on my goals of providing social justice to those who need it.

My interest in corporate law stems from my work experience in retail and operations at Labatt Brewery and The Beer Store.

My work experience in the highly regulated alcohol industry has played a significant role in shaping my interest in corporate law. At Labatt Brewery, I am responsible for managing customer and vendor relations while ensuring compliance with industry-specific regulations related to health and safety, alcohol sales, and distribution laws. This role requires a thorough understanding of legal requirements and business operations, such as identifying potential risks to ensure compliance with both local and provincial regulations.

Due to past political instability in Hong Kong, my parents immigrated to Canada 30 years ago in hopes of giving their future children a better life. My parents decision to immigrate had indeed given me the life they imagined, and I would love to give back to the community, especially for those with immigration issues.

I am also passionate about helping those experiencing poverty. During the pandemic, my family experienced pretty severe financial uncertainty, where my father lost his job. My mother also had could not work due to the nature of her job being in-person. Thus, our family had moments where we could not even afford groceries. However, during these difficult times, my family received much-needed help from friends and family who gave to us without expecting return.  Having received help during times of poverty, it has created in me a sense of gratitude. Therefore, I would like to be able to give back to those experiencing poverty using my education.

Additionally, before the pandemic, there was an immigrant woman from Nigeria at church that my mom and I continuously donated to, as we noticed that they were living in poverty and had no winter clothes for their children. A few years later, the woman and her husband suddenly showed up at our door, and told us that they were now doing really well. They thanked me and my mom profusely and said that because of our help, they were able to get off their feet, start a small company, and make a living for themselves in Canada. They told us that they now had a car and a house and were living really well. I saw first-hand the impact that helping the needy would have. Thus, I am eager to use my legal education to make a difference for those that need it, no matter how small the issue may be.","My interest in a Social Justice and Human Rights Law externship comes from a commitment to advocating for disadvantaged communities to provide equitable access to justice. My academic background in forensic science provided me with an understanding of how systemic issues, such as the misuse of forensic evidence, can impact vulnerable populations in our Canadian justice system. Studying miscarriages of justice during my forensic science degree such as cases from The Goudge Inquiry was a big part of my undergraduate education. This background created an interest in exploring how legal frameworks can be improved for the protection rights and prevention of miscarriages of justice.

I am especially attracted to exploring issues surrounding access to justice and the challenges that disadvantaged groups face in the legal system. I would like to explore how advocacy can be used to handle systemic inequalities. My participation in a negotiation competition, where I advocated for patent rights for my client, gave me the experience of engaging in persuasive dialogue, which would be an important skill for advocacy and policy-driven work.

I would like to use my skills to challenge barriers in the justice system and promote fair representation for all individuals, regardless of background or circumstance.
","I am interested in a Private/Civil Law externship because I want to develop skills in dispute resolution and advocacy. My background in forensic science has given me skills like analytical reasoning and attention to detail. These skills are both necessary for case analysis, reviewing evidence, and making good legal arguments. My academic foundation in conjunction with my legal writing coursework has given me experience in dealing with research-intensive tasks and clear communication, which are important in civil law.

Specifically, I am attracted to private law because of my interest in improving negotiation skills, client advocacy, and problem-solving. My experience in a negotiation competition gave me the experience of thinking strategically under pressure, which is a skill I would like to refine in private law. This externship also gives me a platform to further my knowledge in private law.

This externship would give me the necessary exposure to the practical skills and professional development I would need for future roles in civil law.
",,,,"My interest in a Family Law externship is deeply personal. I saw the profound impact that family law decisions can have on my own family. My cousin, despite being fitter parent, lost parental rights during a divorce because of the wealth and influence of his ex-wifeâs family in Hong Kong. This result not only showed me the systemic challenges that could arise in custody disputes but also made evident the immense emotional impact it could have on the childâs upbringing. Witnessing how these decisions influenced the childâs well-being has driven me to explore a career where I would be able to fight for the best interests of children.

Therefore, my curiosity in family law has led to an interest in exploring the following question: How can frameworks in family law safeguard the best interests of the child without being unfairly influenced by family power or socioeconomic status? An externship in family law would help me explore this question and provide valuable experience for a future career in family law.

",,"I am highly interested in a externship opportunity in Intellectual Property. Intellectual Property law was one of the areas that personally drew me to law school in the first place. Additionally, I am currently considering Intellectual Property as my area of concentration after first year. Thus, an externship in this area of law would help me further explore my interest in this area of law.

My academic background in the forensic sciences has led me to have a wide variety of experiences within the sciences, giving me sufficient scientific literacy to understand client needs for intellectual property issues within the sciences.

Personally, I have a deep interest in technology and would love to explore the interactions between technology and the law, which is another reason for my interest in intellectual property. I grew up with a father who had a deep interest in technology. My father was a computer programmer, which led to a lot of quality being spent with him exploring, comparing, and discussing different technology. Therefore, my personal connection to technology was also a contributing factor that sparked an interest in intellectual property law.

This plan was solidified during my undergraduate in criminology, which provided proof that tough on crime narratives are not effective at reducing crime in any meaningful way. As a result, I believe that working in the field of public interest is directly connected to criminal law because the negative social conditions that areas of public interest seek to improve are largely criminogenic in nature, and it is the mitigation of these factors that has an ameliorating effect on crime rates. Working in this field would provide me with valuable insight as to the material conditions and needs of those involved with the legal system, and I believe that this would provide me with the experience necessary to be an effective lawyer. I am especially interested in these issues as experienced by women, particularly in regards to the intersection of misogyny that often goes unaddressed.
	I believe that my background makes me a good candidate for this area of practice because I have firsthand experience in regards to the effects of a lack of social services. I come from Northern Ontario, where there are extremely limited resources in regards to education, poverty, and healthcare, particularly in the realm of addiction and disability. As a result, I have personally been affected by the lack of healthcare and disability resources, and have lost a family member to addiction. Issues of public interest are close to home for me. These experiences mean that issues are not an abstract or academic idea to me because at times in my life my family or others close to me either could have, or have been, in similar conditions to those benefitted by this field of work.
It is for these reasons that I am interested in participating in the SA1L program in this particular area of work, and I hope to gain valuable experience as a result. Thank you for your consideration,

My interest in this intersection was solidified during my undergraduate in criminology, in which my courses were largely focused on the impact of social issues on crime. As a result, I believe that social justice and human rights issues are critical to the field of criminal law, particularly criminal defense, and are important in challenging tough on crime narratives and ensuring access to justice. 
I believe that my background makes me a good candidate for this area of practice not only because of my undergraduate in criminology but because of my own personal experiences growing up in Northern Ontario. I grew up as the only openly gay person in my high school and I feel like this necessitated that I take an interest in human rights at a young age, something that I have never departed from. I also have first hand experience dealing with the inadequacy of Ontarioâs psychiatric healthcare system and I believe that this has given me a unique perspective that is useful in the realm of mental health and disability law. 
My goal is to work in an area of criminal law that has an intersection with social justice and human rights law, and I am especially interested in feminist issues such as addressing the impact of misogyny on women and girls within the criminal justice system and increasing access to justice for victims of sex-based violence.

I am primarily interested in womenâs rights issues, and I believe that the widespread and extremely topical nature of these issues are transferable to any area of public law. I am also very interested in Indigenous issues across North America, especially when this intersects with the rights of women and girls. 
I believe I am a good candidate because of my background in criminology, particularly as a result of my experience in classes centered around the discussion of corporate crime and human rights violations extending beyond Canadian borders. I also believe that my electives in womenâs studies and Native American literature have helped to expose me to issues that require the intervention of international law.

My final paper in this class was about workersâ rights violations in Northern Ontarioâs mining sector and this sparked my other major interest in the field: the way in which harm to workers is framed as both uncommon and trivial despite being a far more pervasive form of crime than that which receives the majority of attention.
I believe that this class in particular has given me academic experience that makes me a good candidate for a position in this area. Additionally, I believe that my own personal experience has given me an understanding of some of the issues in this field of law as they impact individual workers. I worked for minimum wage in service positions throughout highschool and my undergraduate degree in order to pay for my education, and as a result I am passionate about making any kind of improvement in this area. 
It is for these reasons that I am interested in participating in the SA1L program in this area of law, and I hope to gain valuable experience that I believe can be translated across disciplines as a result. Thank you for your consideration.","I plan on working in public law and I am particularly interested in womenâs rights and access to legal assistance for women and girls. My goal is to one day work in the field of criminal law and concentrate my work where that area of law intersects with feminist issues. I am especially interested in family law as it pertains to issues experienced by women and girls and I believe that this field of law would provide me with a  opportunity to gain a better insight into the needs of a demographic I want to work with.
	I believe that my background in criminology makes me a good candidate for this position because of the focus my courses placed on the impact of various social issues on the legal system. This was especially the case in my class on youth crime, where great importance is placed on child welfare. Further, I feel that my experience growing up in Northern Ontario has provided me with an appreciation of the need for accessible family law, as there is a severe lack of resources devoted towards child support or welfare. 
It is for these reasons that I am interested in participating in the SA1L program in this area of work, and I am looking forward to gaining valuable experience as a result.

My interest in this area persists throughout my coursework and research, and my experience working in an advocacy organization also hones my communication and management skills necessary to work in public interest. 

In college, I took courses from contemporary Chinese studies and legal studies,
and found that while domestic abuse is de jure a criminal offense in China, local law enforcement has treated rampant domestic abuse cases with ambivalence. In an unfortunate way, my mom was able to protect herself through blatant violence in the absence of any legal enforcement. Nevertheless, the majority of women in China with similar experiences choose to stay silent and endure suffering. I began to question why the law fails to prevent unjustified violence from happening in such dire situations, and if there are other groups of people facing similar injustices.

To further explore the intersection between law and violence, I conducted legal
history research on the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S. After the federal outlawing of segregation in public transportation, a group of black and white activists were beaten by white supremacists in southern America for sitting together on the bus. I was shocked by the severity of brutal violence the riders suffered. Just like women experiencing domestic abuse in China, the activists could not use the existing system to protect themselves from the unjustified, unlawful violence. Why did the desegregation law fail to forestall the physical attack or punish the racist perpetrators? Reading about the injustices that the activists encountered, I felt a strong desire to understand how law works, and how I could advocate for those people who suffered from unwarranted violence but are overlooked by the system.

I gained hands-on experience speaking out for marginalized communities when I interned at a Massachusetts-based LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, MassEquality. I was responsible for conducting legal research on employment discrimination, examining how micro-aggressions related to gender and sexuality are overlooked in the workplace. I also worked to address concerns from local LGBTQ+ youth, and this task helped me to understand the unique barriers that LGBTQ+ people face when accessing healthcare services, including mental health challenges and misinformation about the American medical system. While interning at MassEquality, I was also tasked with gathering information for Massachusetts midterm election on 30+ candidates, analyzing their positions on LGBTQ+ rights, and compiling them into spreadsheets to assist with 10+ endorsement decisions. Through this role, I refined my legal research skills and developed strong organizational and time management skills.","I am deeply committed to advancing social justice and human rights, driven by a belief that the law should amplify the voices of the marginalized and address systemic inequalities. My academic pursuits, research projects, and professional experiences have continually reinforced my dedication to this mission.

While studying International Studies and History in Boston, I took courses in contemporary Chinese studies and legal studies. I found that while domestic abuse is de jure a criminal offense in China, local law enforcement often responds to cases with ambivalence. The majority of victims therefore chose to stay silent and endure suffering. This study illuminated for me the silence and suffering endured by many women in similar situations and deepened my desire to understand why legal systems often fail to protect those most in need.

To expand my understanding of how law intersects with violence, I conducted legal history research on the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S. Learning about the Freedom Riders, a group of Black and white activists who faced brutal violence from white supremacists despite the desegregation of public transportation, I was struck by the parallels with domestic abuse cases in China. Both highlighted how laws can fall short of preventing systemic violence or ensuring accountability. These injustices strengthened my determination to explore how the law can better serve as a tool for protection and advocacy.

My commitment to human rights was further solidified through my internship at MassEquality, a Massachusetts-based advocacy organization. There, I conducted legal research on employment discrimination, focusing on how microaggressions related to gender and sexuality are often overlooked in the workplace. I also worked to address the concerns of local LGBTQ+ youth, many of whom face significant barriers to accessing healthcare, including mental health services. Additionally, I analyzed the legislative stances of 30+ midterm election candidates on LGBTQ+ rights, compiling data to guide endorsement decisions. These experiences refined my legal research and organizational skills while deepening my understanding of how systemic inequalities impact marginalized communities.",,"As one of the four international students in Western Lawâs 2027 graduating class, I was born and raised in China. I first became interested in comparative international law and gender-based crimes during my undergraduate studies in Boston. While pursuing a double major in International Studies and History, I took courses in contemporary Chinese studies and legal studies, where I explored the intersection of law, culture, and social justice. I was particularly intrigued to learn that, while domestic abuse is de jure a criminal offense in China, local law enforcement often exhibits ambivalence toward its growing prevalence.

My legal history research on the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S. deepened my understanding of how legal systems address issues like sexual assault and domestic violence. Comparing the U.S. and China's approaches revealed the influence of societal values and legal frameworks on justice for marginalized communities. This comparative lens fostered my passion for international law, where I aim to address global disparities like gender-based violence and advocate for more equitable legal protections across borders.
Â 
My oral history research, too, amplified the lesser-heard undertones of mainstream narratives. While official records highlight militarism and animosity, I gathered stories from Asian American elders who experienced most of the 20th century, capturing tales of cross-cultural friendships and exchanges. Textbooks lauded the broad strokes of rapid economic growth and
societal transformation. However, I recorded stories from elders who recalled how the rare, magnificent Orthodox churches were tragically razed overnight, ignoring the international treaty against the destruction of cultural property. 

These experiences have solidified my interest in international law, where diverse legal systems intersect and shape global solutions to shared challenges. Whether addressing gender-based crimes, advocating for human rights, or preserving cultural heritage, I am driven by the belief that the law can be a transformative tool for justice and equity on a global scale.",,,,"I believe that my ability to work independently, and my communication and organizational skills make me an excellent intern in Business Law. 

While working as a full-time sales associate at Meltwater, an American media-monitoring company, I cold-called and demoed for more than 5 C-level executives across various industries and identified their core challenges through conversations each day. I quickly familiarized myself with niche industries, summarized their business models, and shared my findings with colleagues through internal documents. I also self-studied successful cases in the industry and leveraged similar strategies to pitch to clients with diverse business objectives, including Chinese technology companies that seek to enhance their performance overseas, and foreign new consumer companies aiming to expand their market share in China. This position gave me the opportunity to work independently and take initiatives to find solutions in a business context, and I believe this ability would be an asset for the type of work I expect to see in a business law internship.
Â 
While at Meltwater, I further improved my communication skills through conversations with clients and colleagues. At the beginning of my role, I received extensive training on how to be an effective listener as a sales associate. I spent a significant amount of time listening to my clientsâ business goals, pinpointing their concerns, and verbally described how Meltwaterâs products could address them. At the same time, I also presented my deal progress to teams across Asia-Pacific. Additionally, my communication skills were honed when I interned in a Massachusetts-based advocacy organization, MassEquality. While working as a project manager, I worked to address concerns from local LGBTQ+ youth who are at higher risk of mental health challenges and face barriers and misinformation in accessing healthcare services. In the meantime, I was also tasked with gathering information for Massachusetts midterm election on 30+ candidates, analyzing their positions on LGBTQ+ rights, and compiling them into spreadsheets to assist with 10+ endorsement decisions. Through this role, I also developed strong organizational and time management skills. I believe that this experience and the associated skills will be transferrable when working with future clients.","I am excited to pursue a career in IP law, where the convergence of technology, innovation, and legal advocacy shapes the future of industries. My professional experiences have equipped me with the skills and perspective to bridge the gap between business and law, particularly in safeguarding the ideas and technologies that drive social progress.

As a sales associate at Meltwater, an American SaaS (software as a service) company, I gained valuable insights into the intersection of technology, innovation, and business. In this role, I frequently engaged with clients to discuss how social listening tools could be leveraged to enhance their strategies, offering tailored solutions based on their unique needs on marketing and public relations. These conversations deepened my understanding of how proprietary technologies, like Meltwaterâs media analytics and social listening tools, create competitive advantages in the marketplace.

Explaining how Meltwater's products differed from and outperformed competitors gave me a strong appreciation for the importance of intellectual property rights in safeguarding innovations and ensuring market differentiation. Through my training in product development and competitor analysis, I saw how maintaining the integrity of softwares was not just a business necessity but also a driving force behind fostering innovation. This experience sparked my interest in intellectual property law, as I recognized its critical role in protecting technological advancements, ensuring fair competition, and supporting the innovators who drive progress. I believe that my communication skills, analytical thinking, and business acumen can assist future clients in navigating the complex landscape of IP law and safeguarding their creative and technological assets.",192890.0,application/pdf,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_3kdE99MN4F894vG,,,,,,,,https://uwo.eu.qualtrics.com/Q/File.php?F=F_2EmkXV1XwyiIfSt,,,3.0,2.0,,1.0,,,,5.0,4.0

I remember not understanding how that was at all fair, why could my teachers strike for better pay and more breaks, but my mother couldnât? This led to a years-long curiosity about systemic barriers, particularly in areas like workplace equity, collective bargaining, and employee rights, which drives my desire to explore the complexities of labour and employment law. I hope to use my legal training to address issues such as fair wages, workplace discrimination, and access to collective representation.

My experience working as a volunteer for Pro Bono Students Canada on the Nokee-Kwe project has deepened my understanding of the importance of labour and employment laws for both employees and employers. I lead sessions educating employees as well as small and medium-sized businesses on their rights and obligations as employees and/or employers. I have been able to see how important it is to foster an equitable and compliant environment with Ontario labour laws and the role that clear and accessible information plays in ensuring this can happen. Being able to educate people about their rights and obligations as both employees and employers has been an outlet for advocacy that I have found deeply rewarding and interesting. 

I hope to use my knowledge of labour and employment law to help those who are struggling with labour concerns. From blatant employment discrimination to ensuring that a job offer is legal and fair, I plan to leverage my advocacy skills in order to help people seek the legal answers and outcomes they are looking for.

 Under the supervision of Miller Thomson LLP, I conducted client interviews, researched and applied relevant laws and case law, drafted memorandums, employment contracts and agreements and advised on IP protection. This provided hands-on experience in private and civil law as I tackled realâworld issues commonly faced by businesses including contract disputes, employment issues, and IP protection. As these challenges were common to clients, I learned how to effectively advise and resolve conflicts between private parties while developing my interpersonal skills by providing advice rooted in trust and transparency. 

Following my clinic experience, I worked as a Court and Client Representative at the Ontario Court of Justice Toronto (OCJT). This opportunity paved my passion for litigation and oral advocacy as I was exposed to intellectually challenging cases and opportunities to make a difference.

Labour lawâs emphasis on innovation in legal solutions resonates with the mindset I have cultivated in navigating unfamiliar challenges through novel approaches.

By introducing a new initiative, I created new opportunities for collaboration within the student body. These experiences have reinforced the importance of innovative thinking in promoting meaningful solutions.  

I deeply admire how labour law approaches client-service by building lasting relationships. I saw this principle in action from a young age when I accompanied my father to client meetings, for the business he was forced to open due to his lack of success in employment. His personalized attentiveness to each client highlighted how strong relationships drive success. This early exposure stayed with me as I developed my own client-service skills as a server and barista. Whether it was taking time to understand a regularâs preferences or ensuring a customerâs concerns were heard during a busy service, I learned to adapt and ensure every customer felt valued. These client-service skills prepared me to establish rapport and deliver tailored advice in the unfamiliar context of legal consultation during the BLG Client Consultation Competition.

The vast majority of clients had a story, and it provided me with an appreciation for how often private/civil law affects people. Private law creates fairness and equity between individuals, and I would appreciate the opportunity to delve deeper into the law that governs individual and societal relationships, as opposed to exclusively law between corporations.

By completing courses on health policy and the social determinants of health, I became aware of the role that informed policy decisions can play in diverting the polarization of populational health and well-being. This understanding makes me committed to pursuing a legal career in the public policy sector, to work toward removing systemic health inequities through policy reform. A public interest law externship presents an invaluable opportunity to leverage my knowledge regarding the impact of systemic barriers on public health, to drive meaningful change. Through this experience, I will gain practical insight into how the legal system can address fundamental issues regarding immigration, education, housing, poverty, and disability. This will diversify my perspective on addressing social inequities that directly impact public health, further preparing me to advance my goal of developing policies that foster systemic reform through my legal career. 

As a member of Pro Bono Students Canadaâs Disability and Accessibility Project, I hold practical experience in the public interest law sector. In conducting legal research on disability law and creating accessible educational materials for those who identify as disabled, this role has enriched my understanding of the systemic barriers that the disabled community encounters in seeking access to employment and educational resources, as well as strengthened my skills in legal research, advocacy, and communication. Partnering with the Canadian National Institute for the Blind has further enriched my public-interest-related research experience, through working first-hand with the visually-impaired community. By collecting personal testimonies of the barriers faced by those living with visual impairment and subsequently preparing a national educational campaign to promote accessibility, I heightened my ability to empathetically and effectively address the diverse needs of those in equity-deserving groups. Coupled with my academic background, these experiences have instilled in me the analytical and personal skills which I will apply to meaningfully contribute to a public interest law externship by performing inclusive, client-centred legal work.","Witnessing an immediate family memberâs arrest and subsequent incarceration allowed me to gain a diverse lens on the impact that systemic barriers to accessing justice have on marginalized communities. Through watching someone so dear to me struggle to navigate the justice system due to a lack of education and financial resources, I learned the harsh reality faced by many when seeking justice. This has served as a pivotal experience that solidified my commitment to pursuing a legal career aimed at driving systemic reform by advocating for those often overlooked. A social justice and human rights law externship is an invaluable opportunity to transform a traumatic experience into a powerful tool for advocacy while gaining practical knowledge on how the legal system can be utilized to challenge systemic inequities and improve the lives of the underserved. 

My involvement as a member of Pro Bono Students Canadaâs Disability and Accessibility Education project has provided me with practical experience in using legal tools to promote the rights of those in equity-seeking communities. In conducting legal research and turning findings into plain-language content to inform students about their rights concerning disability law and accessibility, this project has further increased my commitment to translating legal principles into actionable knowledge, a pivotal instrument in driving meaningful change and furthering social justice. 

As a Western orientation leader, I advocated for action to be taken following a surge of gender-based violence allegations within university residences. Through participating in every town hall meeting discussing this issue and a peaceful class walk-out to demand the prioritization of student safety, I gained first-hand experience in advocating for meaningful change in my community. Additionally, I have further practiced and developed my advocacy skills in my role as Western Lawâs Persian Student Associationâs 1L representative, through which I clearly communicate and advocate for the needs and priorities of my peers. Coupled with my diverse perspective and devotion to removing the barriers to accessing justice, I look forward to applying and refining my legal research and advocacy skills in a social justice and human rights externship to work towards advancing the rights of others.",,,,"I am particularly drawn to the field of labour and employment law because of its pivotal role in improving the lives of others. My academic background in the fields of both health studies and psychology has made me well-informed on how equitable and fair treatment in the workplace can transform oneâs life. In taking classes on topics such as the psychology of work and the social determinants of health, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of how employment characteristics, such as working conditions, intersect with oneâs mental and physical health. As a first-year law student, I have become particularly interested in learning more about labour and employment law, due to its potential for safeguarding the rights of others while fostering an environment that encourages individuals to prosper both personally and professionally. 

The diverse roles that I have held provide me with the necessary skills needed in order to succeed in a labour and employment law externship As a billing coordinator, I have developed strong problem-solving, negotiation, and communication skills through engaging in complex disputes over service charges and pay regulation. With each series of negotiations,  I have prioritized and advocated for the fair pay of employees while balancing their interests with the specific needs of clients, a practical experience that I will apply to my role in a labour and employment law context to further the needs of others. 

I am eager to apply my unique perspective and skills to this externship, where I will gain valuable experience and knowledge on how labour and employment law can address fundamental issues such as employee mental health and well-being, equitable compensation, workplace discrimination and environments, particularly with respect to marginalized communities. This externship will serve as a meaningful experiential learning opportunity in which I will immerse myself in applying legal frameworks to the protection of workers' rights, practical knowledge that will allow me to better serve those in my community through a future career as a lawyer in the employment and labour sector.  
",,"As a first-year law student with a bachelorâs degree in health studies, I am particularly interested in the intersection of law and public health. In exploring this intersection, the fundamental role that business practices play in shaping societal outcomes became clear to me. As a result of my knowledge of the social determinants of health, I have noticed the unparalleled opportunity that the business law sector offers to work with companies in a manner that reinforces positive social reform. As mentioned, businesses and corporations can have a critical impact on particular social outcomes, such as wage gaps, business procedures, lived environments, and human rights, through their decisions as crucial contributors to the global economy. Considering this overarching impact, I am eager to pursue a career in business law and work with organizations driven by a commitment to foster inclusive, equitable, and positive social reform through the legal system. The diverse nature of business law offers an invaluable opportunity to leverage my skills and experiences to meaningfully contribute to developing corporate procedures and policies that are socially just, equitable, and reliable.

As an undergraduate research assistant for the Evans Lab at Western University, I contributed to a future meta-analytic review, during which I analyzed and extracted data from over one hundred peer-reviewed journal articles and formulated key evidence. Additionally, as a volunteer legal intern at Avanessy Giordano LLP, I further improved my research capabilities by conducting extensive legal research and compiling key legal principles from relevant case law to assist attorneys in meeting the needs of clients during an active case appeal. Lastly, since becoming a law student, I have continued to work towards developing my legal research and writing skills both through my position as a member of Pro Bono Student Canadaâs Disability and Accessibility Education Project, as well as in my Legal Research, Writing, and Advocacy course throughout the academic year. Through these experiences, I have developed comprehensive analytical and overall research skills that I will apply to meaningfully contribute to legal research findings and solving complex legal issues through my role in a business law externship. 
","As a first-year law student with a bachelorâs degree in health studies, I am particularly interested in intellectual property (IP) lawâs role in driving innovation in the healthcare sector. Through my academic background, I have developed a unique perspective on the direct impact access to critical healthcare resources has on public health, particularly the polarization of national health and well-being. This perspective has shaped my interest in learning how to establish a balance between incentivizing meaningful healthcare advancements through legal protections while ensuring such innovations are accessible to marginalized communities. This externship offers an unparalleled opportunity to leverage my academic background and devotion to fostering equitable healthcare while gaining firsthand experience in using legal tools to promote impactful innovation, better preparing me for a future career in IP law within the healthcare sector. 

Operating as a member of Pro Bono Students Canadaâs Disability and Accessibility project has enlightened me on how legal tools can be employed to enhance access to fundamental resources for marginalized communities. This role has further solidified my aspiration to contribute to the creation of legal safeguards for fundamental healthcare innovations that promote a more inclusive and equitable society within the evolving field of IP law.  

Furthermore, as an undergraduate research assistant, I strengthened my research and analytical skills by collecting evidence from over one hundred journal articles for a meta-analytic review, reinforcing my capacity to synthesize large data collections, identify vital evidence, and effectively present findings. Lastly, through volunteering as a legal intern, I gained valuable experience conducting case-specific legal research by analyzing relevant case law and extracting legal principles to formulate answers to complex legal issues, demonstrating my ability to employ legal frameworks in a practical environment. These experiences have allowed me to develop the interdisciplinary skillset necessary to thrive in an IP law externship, which I will apply to analyze patent law, copyright issues, and the broader implications of IP law.

I eagerly anticipate utilizing my diverse perspective and capabilities to drive innovation while expanding my knowledge of IP law to work towards the promotion of influential, equitable healthcare innovations in the future.

As a Muslim woman from an immigrant family, I have observed how cultural and language barriers can hinder access to justice for marginalized communities. These experiences have inspired me to pursue a legal career focused on advocacy and addressing systemic inequities.

During my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto, I studied Criminology to understand how the legal system impacts marginalized communities. This foundation has guided my current legal studies at Western University, where I am a first-year law student and an Associate Caseworker at Community Legal Services (CLS). I chose to work at CLS because of its mission to provide access to justice and serve the public interest. Collaborating with caseworkers and lawyers, I hope to further develop my research, communication, and client advocacy skills, which are essential for effective public interest work.

My volunteer experience as a mentor with the International Education Centre at the University of Toronto also informs my passion for public interest law. In this role, I supported international students navigating the challenges of adapting to a new environment. By providing resources and fostering inclusion, I developed a deep appreciation for the importance of listening to individual needs and tailoring solutions to unique circumstances. This experience reinforced my understanding of how cultural awareness and empathy are critical in addressing barriers to justiceâvalues I carry into my legal advocacy work.

I am particularly interested in issues involving housing and poverty, as my work at CLS has exposed me to cases before the Landlord and Tenant Board, sparking my curiosity about the intersection of housing insecurity and socioeconomic justice. Additionally, my internship at ADR Chambers, where I assisted with construction contract cases and wrote auditing reports for the Office of the Integrity Commissioner, further honed my ability to collaborate, conduct detailed research, and resolve complex disputesâskills I aim to apply to create meaningful change.
Ultimately, I aspire to use my legal education to empower vulnerable populations and dismantle systemic barriers. By leveraging my personal experiences and dedication to advocacy, I aim to ensure that justice and equality are accessible to all.","My passion for social justice and human rights law is deeply rooted in my personal experiences and academic pursuits. Growing up as a Muslim woman in an immigrant family, I witnessed how systemic barriers, cultural biases, and language gaps hinder access to justice for marginalized communities. These experiences instilled in me a strong sense of responsibility to advocate for equality and fairness, inspiring my pursuit of a legal career centered on addressing societal inequities.

During my undergraduate studies in Criminology, Law, and Society at the University of Toronto, I explored the ways in which legal systems disproportionately affect vulnerable groups. I augmented this academic foundation by volunteering as a mentor with the International Education Centre, where I supported international students navigating the challenges of a new environment. This role emphasized the importance of empathy and cultural awareness in ensuring equitable access to resources, qualities that are integral to human rights advocacy.

Currently, as a first-year law student at Western University and an Associate Caseworker at Community Legal Services (CLS), I have had the privilege of learning from experienced lawyers about clients who face various legal challenges. Through hands-on involvement in cases, including drafting legal correspondence, I have gained practical insights into how legal systems can be used to empower individuals. Collaborating with lawyers and caseworkers, I have developed research, communication, and organizational skills critical to social justice work.

Additionally, my professional experiences as an intern at ADR Chambers, where I assisted with construction contract cases and wrote auditing reports for the Office of the Integrity Commissioner, further honed my ability to collaborate, conduct detailed research, and resolve complex disputesâskills I aim to apply to create meaningful change.

An externship in the area of Social Justice and Human Rights Law represents an invaluable opportunity to deepen my understanding of systemic inequities and refine the skills necessary to advocate effectively for those whose rights are at risk. My goal is to pursue a legal career dedicated to protecting the rights of marginalized populations and advancing equitable outcomes. I am eager to contribute my dedication, lived experiences, and growing legal expertise to this critical area of law.",,,,"My interest in labour and employment law is rooted in a strong desire to promote fair and equitable workplaces for all individuals. I am drawn to this field because it directly addresses the dynamic relationship between employers and employees, with a focus on protecting workers' rights, ensuring workplace safety, and fostering inclusive environments. In a rapidly evolving world of work, I see labour and employment law as a crucial tool for advocating for the dignity, respect, and well-being of individuals in the workplace.

During my studies at the University of Toronto, I developed a strong foundation in social justice, which deepened my understanding of the systemic issues that affect marginalized groups in the workforce. As a first-year law student at Western University, I continue to explore how the law can serve as a vehicle for advancing equitable practices and addressing the challenges workers face, such as discrimination, wage disparities, and workplace harassment.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable experience through my current role as an Associate Caseworker at Community Legal Services (CLS), where I have seen firsthand the importance of legal advocacy in promoting access to justice for marginalized communities. While CLS primarily focuses on areas outside of labour and employment law, my role has exposed me to the broader implications of how legal protections can benefit individuals navigating systemic issues in various settings, including the workplace.

Additionally, my internship at ADR Chambers provided me with an opportunity to engage with complex legal issues that required attention to detail, critical thinking, and effective communicationâskills essential in labour and employment law. I assisted with construction contract cases and wrote auditing reports for the Office of the Integrity Commissioner which required precision and an understanding of nuanced legal issues.

Labour and employment law is a dynamic and evolving field that offers opportunities to advocate for justice and fairness within the workplace. By gaining practical experience in this field, I hope to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to advocate for workers' rights, promote fair labor practices, and contribute to the creation of inclusive and just work environments.

An externship in labour and employment law would provide me with invaluable insights into this field, helping me to build on my passion for social justice and develop the expertise required to navigate the legal challenges within the workforce. I am eager to contribute my skills, dedication to equity, and commitment to advocacy to this important area of law.",,"My interest in business law stems from a fascination with the complex interplay between legal frameworks and the business world. As an aspiring lawyer with a strong interest in the commercial sector, I am drawn to business law because it offers the opportunity to support entrepreneurs, corporations, and other entities in navigating legal challenges while fostering economic growth and innovation. 

During my studies at the University of Toronto, I took courses related to law and society that deepened my understanding of the regulatory environment surrounding businesses, including corporate governance, and intellectual property. These experiences sparked my interest in pursuing business law. 

My current role as an Associate Caseworker at Community Legal Services (CLS) has helped me develop key skills transferable to business law. In assisting with various legal cases, I have gained valuable experience in research, drafting legal correspondence, and client communication. While CLS primarily focuses on areas such as family law, civil issues, and landlord-tenant disputes, my exposure to the legal process has enhanced my ability to handle complex legal matters, manage case files, and collaborate with clientsâskills that are essential in business law.

In addition to my work at CLS, my internship at ADR Chambers provided exposure to construction contract law and resolving disputes related to construction contracts. This experience involved carefully reviewing and editing case determinations, working with lawyers to address legal issues in construction projects, and ensuring accuracy in reporting. These experiences honed my attention to detail, problem-solving abilities, and my capacity to think critically in high-stakes situationsâskills that will be highly beneficial in the business law context.

Through an externship in business law, I hope to further refine my legal knowledge and practical skills in this area. I am excited by the prospect of contributing to and learning from the business law sector.","My interest in intellectual property (IP) law stems from a fascination with the interplay between innovation, creativity, and the legal frameworks that protect them. In a world where technological advancements and creative works shape industries and society, IP law offers an opportunity to support innovators, safeguard ideas, and ensure fair access to intellectual contributions.

During my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto, I developed strong research and analytical skills while exploring how legal structures impact individuals and communities. This foundation has been instrumental in my current studies as a first-year law student at Western University, where I am expanding my understanding of the lawâs role in promoting fairness and equity.

My professional experience as a transcriptionist at Winterlight Labs has further fueled my interest in IP law. Winterlight is a company at the intersection of technology and healthcare, utilizing artificial intelligence to assess speech patterns for clinical purposes. My role involved handling sensitive clinical audio data, ensuring confidentiality, and contributing to quality assurance efforts. This experience exposed me to the importance of protecting intellectual property in a fast-evolving technological landscape. It also deepened my appreciation for how legal protections can enable companies to innovate while maintaining ethical standards.

As a legal intern at ADR Chambers, I honed skills essential for IP practice, including meticulous attention to detail, drafting, and problem-solving. Assisting with complex construction contract cases and auditing reports required precision and an understanding of nuanced legal issues. These experiences, combined with my interest in technology, position me to navigate the technical and legal intricacies of IP law effectively.

What excites me most about IP law is its dynamic nature and the opportunity to contribute to a field that bridges creativity and commerce. My goal is to develop expertise in this area and build on my skills, gain practical insights, and work at the forefront of legal innovation.
